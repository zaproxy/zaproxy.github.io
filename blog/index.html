              <section class="summary">We have just released a new feature for ZAP that allows you to launch browsers from within ZAP. The browsers are automatically configured to proxy via ZAP and ignore certificate warnings, making it much easier for people to get started with ZAP as well as for more experienced users who want to use ZAP with a variety of browsers. You can install and use Browser Launch right now via the ZAP Marketplace, which can be accessed via the &lsquo;Manage Add-ons&rsquo; button in ZAP:</section>

              <section class="summary">The previous ZAP blog post explained how you could Explore APIs with ZAP.
This blog post goes one step further, and explains how you can both explore and perform security scanning of APIs using ZAP from the command line.
This allows you to easily automate the scanning of your APIs.
Following the approach taken by the Baseline Scan we have introduced a new API scanning script which has only one dependency – Docker.</section>

              <section class="summary">APIs can be challenging for security testing for a variety of reasons.
The first problem you will encounter is how to effectively explore an API - most APIs cannot be explored using browsing or standard spidering techniques.
However many APIs are described using technologies such as:
 SOAP OpenAPI / Swagger  These standards define the API endpoints and can be imported into ZAP using 2 optional add-ons.
Installing the add-ons In order to import the API definitions you will need to add the relevant add-ons from the ZAP Marketplace.</section>

              <h6 id="date"> Mon Feb 6, 2017 </h6>
              <section class="summary">As modern web applications are increasing their reliance on JavaScript, security tools that do not understand JavaScript will not be able to work effectively with them. ZAP already has components like the Ajax Spider and DOM XSS scanner that work by launching browsers and controlling them via Selenium, and we are planning to make much more use of browsers in the future.
To that end we are planning on releasing a new ZAP add-on which will contain JxBrowser, a wrapper around Chromium.</section>

For the first newsletter of 2016 we have a special feature on a new vulnerability “XCOLD Information Leak” that caught the eye of one of our key contributors, how he found it and how you can use a new ZAP rule to detect it.
News Steve Springett (@stevespringett) has implemented a ZAP Sonar plugin which integrates ZAP into SonarQube v5.1 or higher. He’s also looking for anyone interested in maintaining this going forwards, so please have a play with it and get in touch with Steve and/or myself if you might be interested in keeping it going.</section>

The idea behind this development is to enhance ZAP so that it can be run in a ‘server’ mode.
This is different to the current ‘daemon’ mode in that it will be designed to be a long running, highly scalable, distributed service accessed by multiple users with different roles.</section>

              <section class="summary">Hello everybody, my name is Alberto Verza, a 23 year student from Spain, and this summer I have participated in Google Summer of Code 2014. My project was the SOAP Scanner add-on for ZAP, in which I worked during all the Program. Let me explain you the features it includes.
One of the interesting features this add-on provides is WSDL file scanning. Until now, ZAP could find these kind of files and it could even search URLs inside them, but further petitions to these URLs had not a valid SOAP format specified by the WSDL file.</section>

The previous post in this series is: Hacking ZAP #3 - Passive scan rules
Active scan rules are another relatively simple way to enhance ZAP. Active scan rules attack the server, and therefore are only run when explicitly invoked by the user. You should only use active scan rules against applications that you have permission to attack.</section>

The previous post in this series is: Hacking ZAP #2 - Getting Started
One of the easiest ways to enhance ZAP is to write new passive scan rules.
Passive scan rules are used to warn the user of potential vulnerabilities that can be detected passively - they are not allowed to make any new requests or manipulate the requests or responses in any way.</section>

In order to change the ZAP source code you will need to set up a development environment.
Requirements The following software is used/required to obtain and build ZAP (core) and the add-ons:
 A JDK (minimum version 8), for example, Zulu JDK or AdoptOpenJDK; Git, to obtain the source code; Gradle, to build the source code.</section>

ZAP is an open source tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications. It is the most active OWASP project and is very community focused - it probably has more contributors than any other web application security tool. It is being continually enhanced and, unusually for a security tool, has been translated into over 25 languages thanks to over 70 translators.</section>

              <section class="summary">We are getting close to releasing the next major version of ZAP.
As there are so many changes we've decided to go to version 2.0.0 rather than 1.5, and some of the biggest changes have come about thanks to the Google Summer of Code (GSoC).
This is the first year in which ZAP has taken part in the GSoC, and it has been a resounding success.
In this post I'll give you an overview of the 3 GSoC projects, and an easy way to try them out if you can't wait for the full release.</section>

              <section class="summary">I've been struggling with the question of ZAP releases.
We've made loads of enhancements to ZAP recently, and I want them to be available to as wide an audience as possible.
But I also want to make sure our &lsquo;full&rsquo; releases remain as robust and stable as possible.
I want to get the next full release (2.0.0) out of the door asap, but I still want to get a load more features into it.</section>
