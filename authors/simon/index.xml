      <description>On September 6th 2010 I posted this message to Bugtraq: Title - The Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) version 1.0.0. From those very humble beginnings ZAP has now become what we believe is the world’s most frequently used web application scanner.</description>

      <description>I’ve stated that ZAP is the world’s most popular free and open source web application scanner on stage at security conferences around the world for many years. No one has ever contradicted me so it must be true :)
However I’ve started to wonder if ZAP is actually more popular than most if not all of the commercial scanners as well?</description>

      <description>We have just released a new feature for ZAP that allows you to launch browsers from within ZAP. The browsers are automatically configured to proxy via ZAP and ignore certificate warnings, making it much easier for people to get started with ZAP as well as for more experienced users who want to use ZAP with a variety of browsers.</description>

      <description>The previous ZAP blog post explained how you could Explore APIs with ZAP.
This blog post goes one step further, and explains how you can both explore and perform security scanning of APIs using ZAP from the command line.
This allows you to easily automate the scanning of your APIs.</description>

      <title>Exploring APIs with ZAP</title>

      <guid>/blog/2017-04-03-exploring-apis-with-zap/</guid>
      <description>APIs can be challenging for security testing for a variety of reasons.
The first problem you will encounter is how to effectively explore an API - most APIs cannot be explored using browsing or standard spidering techniques.
However many APIs are described using technologies such as:
 SOAP OpenAPI / Swagger  These standards define the API endpoints and can be imported into ZAP using 2 optional add-ons.</description>

      <title>Introducing the JxBrowser add-on for ZAP</title>

      <guid>/blog/2017-02-06-introducing-the-jxbrowser-add-on-for-zap/</guid>
      <description>As modern web applications are increasing their reliance on JavaScript, security tools that do not understand JavaScript will not be able to work effectively with them. ZAP already has components like the Ajax Spider and DOM XSS scanner that work by launching browsers and controlling them via Selenium, and we are planning to make much more use of browsers in the future.</description>

      <description>Unit tests are wonderful things, but they are painful to add to a mature project that doesn’t have enough of them. We would love to have more ZAP unit tests, and we are therefore launching a Unit Test Bounty program, where we pay for unit tests for specific areas of the ZAP codebase.</description>

      <description>At OWASP AppSec EU in Amsterdam this year I announced ZAP as a Service (ZaaS).
The slides are here and the video will hopefully be available soon.
The idea behind this development is to enhance ZAP so that it can be run in a ‘server’ mode.
This is different to the current ‘daemon’ mode in that it will be designed to be a long running, highly scalable, distributed service accessed by multiple users with different roles.</description>

      <description>Welcome to a series of blog posts aimed at helping you “hack the ZAP source code”.
The previous post in this series is: Hacking ZAP #3 - Passive scan rules
Active scan rules are another relatively simple way to enhance ZAP. Active scan rules attack the server, and therefore are only run when explicitly invoked by the user.</description>

      <description>Welcome to a series of blog posts aimed at helping you “hack the ZAP source code”.
The previous post in this series is: Hacking ZAP #2 - Getting Started
One of the easiest ways to enhance ZAP is to write new passive scan rules.
Passive scan rules are used to warn the user of potential vulnerabilities that can be detected passively - they are not allowed to make any new requests or manipulate the requests or responses in any way.</description>

      <description>Welcome to a series of blog posts aimed at helping you “hack the ZAP source code”.
ZAP is an open source tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications. It is the most active OWASP project and is very community focused - it probably has more contributors than any other web application security tool.</description>

      <description>We are getting close to releasing the next major version of ZAP.
As there are so many changes we&amp;rsquo;ve decided to go to version 2.0.0 rather than 1.5, and some of the biggest changes have come about thanks to the Google Summer of Code (GSoC).
This is the first year in which ZAP has taken part in the GSoC, and it has been a resounding success.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling with the question of ZAP releases.
We&amp;rsquo;ve made loads of enhancements to ZAP recently, and I want them to be available to as wide an audience as possible.
But I also want to make sure our &amp;lsquo;full&amp;rsquo; releases remain as robust and stable as possible.</description>

      <description>The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (otherwise known as ZAP) is a free security tool which you can use to find security vulnerabilities in web applications. My name is Simon Bennetts, and I am the ZAP Project Leader; there is also an international group of volunteers who develop and support it.</description>
