      <description>OWASP ZAP is integral to how Mozilla secures the services powering core Firefox features including Accounts, Addons, and Sync for millions of individuals around the world. We support the open source development of ZAP, because it helps us ensure the security and privacy of our users keeping the Internet a global, public resource open and accessible to all.</description>

      <description>When we set out to build StackHawk, we wanted to help teams find and fix vulnerabilities before they deploy to production. As we were building our platform, we needed a scanner that worked for modern development teams. It needed to be easy to automate and be able to test modern single page apps and backing APIs.</description>

      <description>We at we45 and our training venture, AppSecEngineer use and train on ZAP extensively. We strongly believe OWASP ZAP to be the most programmable DAST tool in its class, regardless of commercial or OSS alternatives.
One of the things we do with our clients is to implement continuous DAST scanning as part of their DevSecOps initiatives.</description>

      <description>At OBS, we strive continually to bring our customers peace of mind with strengthened and reinforced application security.
As part of automating our web application and API security, we chose to deploy OWASP ZAP as one of our Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) technologies. This DevSecOps approach helps our developers and engineering teams to detect vulnerabilities, including the OWASP Top Ten Web and API, in CI/CD pipelines before releasing our solutions.</description>

      <description>At Banzai Cloud we use our dast-operator which leverages OWASP ZAP to run baseline scans against the services we deploy on the K8S cluster. This operator deploys OWASP ZAP to the K8S cluster and initiates automated security testing for web applications and APIs based on OpenAPI definitions. Besides the operator responsible for starting the scan against a service, it can prevent opening a vulnerable service to outside.</description>

      <description>Motorola Solutions follows S-SDLC (secure software development lifecycle) best practices for our product development. Similarly, these best practices can be found in another OWASP project, the Software Assurance Maturity Model. We build our software development approach on the OWASP SAMM, to ensure delivery of secure products, from architecture design to the deployment in our own or customer’s infrastructure.</description>
