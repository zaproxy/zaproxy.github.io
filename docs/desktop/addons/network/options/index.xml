      <description>Client Certificates This screen allows you to add a client certificate to use when testing applications protected using mutual SSL.
After adding the certificate it can be set as active in the KeyStore tab.
Unlike other options screens, the changes done to the keystore are not undone if the Options dialogue is cancelled.</description>

      <description>Local Servers/Proxies Local Servers/Proxies This tab allows you to configure the addresses and ports on which ZAP accepts incoming connections.

      <description>Server Certificates This screens allows to manage and configure the root CA certificate and issued certificates.
OWASP ZAP allows you to transparently decrypt SSL connections. For doing so, ZAP has to encrypt each request before sending to the server and decrypt each response, which comes back. But, this is already done by the browser.</description>
