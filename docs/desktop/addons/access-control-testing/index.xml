      <title>Access Control Context Options</title>

      <description>Access Control Context Options The Access Control Context options are present as a panel for each Context when opening the Session Properties dialog. This panel allows ZAP users to define the Access Rules for each User of each Context.
As mentioned on the concepts page, ZAP is making use of the tree-based structure of URLs. So, when configuring the access rules, only 1 rule needs to be set explicitly for an entire subtree, while for the other nodes rules are inferred.</description>
