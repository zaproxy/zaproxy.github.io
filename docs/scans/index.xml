      <description>Google Security Crawl Maze is a comprehensive testbed for web security crawlers.
It is available online at https://security-crawl-maze.app/ and the GitHub repo is https://github.com/google/security-crawl-maze It does appear to be being actively maintained and has merged a fix that we submitted.
As long as one of the ZAP spiders finds the relevant page we count that as a pass, but ideally both spiders will find as many of the URLs as possible.</description>
