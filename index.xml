This screens allows to manage and configure the root CA certificate and issued certificates.
OWASP ZAP allows you to transparently decrypt SSL connections. For doing so, ZAP has to encrypt each request before sending to the server and decrypt each response, which comes back.</description>

      <description>ZAP makes a limited set of &amp;lsquo;calls home&amp;rsquo;, historically via bitly.com URLs.
Bitly was used so that we could get a very limited form of telemetry data without getting access to any sensitive data such as your IP address.
ZAP can be freely downloaded and we get very little feedback from most users - this at least tells us if ZAP is getting more or less popular :)</description>

      <description>OK, so this question doesn&amp;rsquo;t get asked all the time, but it does come up every so often.
So here&amp;rsquo;s the official response:
Firstly, do you really need ZAP rewritten?
ZAP supports all of the JSR 223 scripting languages, so you can already extend ZAP in a very wide range of scripting languages, including JavaScript, Jython, and Jruby.</description>

      <description>We rely on people like yourself to translate ZAP into other languages.
If your language is not available then it means that we, the developers, unfortunately don&amp;rsquo;t speak your language well enough to translate it and no one else has volunteered.
However you can help :)
Get in touch with us if you want to translate ZAP into another language, we&amp;rsquo;d love to hear from you!</description>

      <description>ZAP doesn&amp;rsquo;t just throw a load of payloads at a target to see what happens :)
The payloads are targeted based on the responses to other payloads so that it hopefully zeros in on specific vulnerabilities.
However there a various options:
Try out the custom payloads add-on which is supported by some of the existing rules Change the existing rules to improve them - this blog post is a good place to start: Hacking ZAP: Active Scan Rules - if you do improve them then please submit pull requests :) Write new rules to do whatever you want - this gives you full control, but could be a bit daunting to start with Tweak the User defined attacks.</description>

      <description>In this case prevention is definitely better than cure.
By default when you use the ZAP spider and active scanner then ZAP will access all of the URLs, forms, and functionality it can find. If one of those results in your application sending emails then someone is going to get a LOT of emails.</description>

      <description>False positives are where ZAP raises alerts for things that are not really vulnerabilities. You should make sure that you understand the potential vulnerability being reported and manually test it before concluding that it is not a real vulnerability.
Please report any false positives that you identify supplying as much information as you can, while obfuscating any sensitive information.</description>

      <description>False Negatives are where ZAP fails to identify an issue when it should.
Reporting these problems to us for passive scan rules is straightforward - just let us know the full request and/or response that ZAP should have raised the problem for.
Reporting problems with active scan rules is a bit more tricky, as ZAP will potentially send several requests to detect a specific problem and we need to know how your application responded to each one.</description>

      <description>Scan rules are defined in add-ons so they can be updated and published whenever they are improved.
However this may be less frequently than you might expect, and there are good reasons for that.
Some security tools focus on finding known vulnerabilities in known applications. New vulnerabilities are being found all of the time so the rules for these tools need to be frequently updated.</description>

      <description>Proxying (and therefore passive scanning) requests via ZAP is completely safe and legal, it just allows you to see whats going on.
Spidering is a bit more dangerous. It could cause problems depending on how your application works.
Note that there is an Spider option to not use POST requests - this may be safer but is also likely to reduce the effectiveness of the Spider.</description>

      <description>ZAP is a free tool designed to help everyone secure their own websites. Unfortunately this means that other people can use it to attack your website as well.
ZAP is not designed to be a covert tool - it uses various variations of &amp;ldquo;ZAP&amp;rdquo; in its attacks, so if someone does use ZAP to attack your site then this should be apparent in your web server logs.</description>

      <description>If you run ZAP multiple times against a target then you may well find that the results are subtly different even though the target has not changed.
This is not unusual, and we do not consider this a significant problem.
In our experience it is usually all down to how the application is explored - the traditional and ajax spiders seem to be sensitive to small changes, including things like network speed.</description>

By default ZAP listens on port 8080. If your app also listens on 8080 then you&amp;rsquo;ll need to change one of them to listen on a different port - it&amp;rsquo;s probably easier to change ZAP using the Options Local Proxies screen, remember to change your browser&amp;rsquo;s proxy settings as well: Configuring Proxies.</description>

      <description>There are a number of ways to accomplish selective proxying.
1 - Via a Browser Add-on/Extension Such as FoxyProxy: https://getfoxyproxy.org/ 2 - Via Global Excludes Leveraging Global Excludes you can specify URLs that ZAP should not intercept. 3 - Via a PAC (Proxy Auto-Config) File You can create your own PAC (Proxy Auto-Config) file and dynamically set proxying as you need, then point your browser at it on your harddrive using the file:/// scheme.</description>

      <title>Why can&#39;t ZAP connect to my web application?</title>

      <guid>/faq/why-cant-zap-connect-to-my-website/</guid>
      <description>This is usually not a ZAP problem.
Is your web application actually running?
Can you connect to it using the IP address rather than the FQDN or hostname?
Can you connect to your application from the same machine using another tool like curl?
If you are using one of the ZAP Docker images then be aware that using Docker will change the networking.</description>

      <description>API ZAP provides an Application Programming Interface (API) which allows you to interact with ZAP programmatically.
The API is available in JSON, HTML and XML formats.
A simple web UI which allows you to explore and use the API is available via the URL http://zap/ when you are proxying via ZAP, or via the host and port ZAP is listening on, eg http://localhost:8080/.</description>

      <description>You can use ZAP to perform security regression tests on your own products.
Note that this answer is very basic and WILL need to be improved ;)
You need to have installed Java and ZAP.
To launch ZAP from a Java program you can do something like:

      <description>ZAP understands API formats like JSON and XML and so can be used to scan APIs.
The problem is usually how to effectively explore the APIs.
There are various options:
If your API has an OpenAPI/Swagger definition then you can import it using the OpenAPI add-on. If your API uses GraphQL then you can explore it using the GraphQL add-on.</description>

      <description>Certificate pinning also known as Public Key Pinning &amp;ldquo;is a mechanism for sites to specify which certificate authorities have issued valid certs for that site, and for user-agents to reject TLS connections to those sites if the certificate is not issued by a known-good CA.&amp;rdquo;
Sites that use certificate pinning will typically not be loaded in your browser if you are proxying it through ZAP.</description>

      <description>Options Callback Address screen The Callback Address screen allows you to configure the address used to detect vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to call remote URLs.
In previous versions the ZAP API was used for this purpose, but from 2.6.0 onwards a separate endpoint is used so that target systems no longer need access to the API.</description>

These instructions assume you&amp;rsquo;ve created a user: test@example.com with password: testExample (via http://localhost:8000/register). The following the steps are based on spider/scan of Pixi at http://localhost:8000/ using ZAP 2.</description>

      <description>The information in this FAQ is based on details from: This user group thread
The Vaadin framework makes heavy use of JavaScript, so it seems the Ajax Spider is the way to go.
As you work to figure things out and get them configured correctly it makes sense to starting by proxying your browser through ZAP, identifying the http session and then flagging it as the &amp;lsquo;active session&amp;rsquo; before starting the Ajax Spider.</description>

      <description>As discussed in https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/5469, this issue seems to occur when laptops are docked. (The work around is to un-dock your system.)
This is the same as https://github.com/oracle/visualvm/issues/84 which links to https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8223158
This issue is unfortunately outside the control of the ZAP team.</description>

      <description>When you proxy via ZAP you will often see that some of the Ids in the History tab are &amp;lsquo;missing&amp;rsquo;, e.g. it will jump from 1 to 4 etc.
The missing Ids do not refer to &amp;lsquo;hidden&amp;rsquo; requests that ZAP is making.
Instead those requests (which are not sent at all) are generated by ZAP for &amp;ldquo;internal&amp;rdquo; use only.</description>

      <description>Automation Framework - Monitor Job Test Monitor tests are supported by long running jobs, such as activeScan and spider.
Unlike the other Job Tests, monitor tests run while a job is running. They work in a similar way to statistic tests in that they check a specified statistic, but there is no &amp;lsquo;operator&amp;rsquo; - instead the test will fail if the value of the statistic exceeds the given threshold.</description>

      <guid>/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/options/dynsslcert/</guid>
      <description>Option Dynamic SSL Certificates OWASP ZAP allows you to transparently decrypt SSL connections. For doing so, ZAP has to encrypt each request before sending to the server and decrypt each response, which comes back. But, this is already done by the browser. That&amp;rsquo;s why, the only way to decrypt or intercept the transmission, is to do a &amp;lsquo;manipulator in the middle&amp;rsquo; approach.</description>

      <description>HTTP Sessions tab This tab shows you the set of identified HTTP sessions for each Site, as detected by the HTTP Sessions extension.
The current Site the information is referring to can be selected via the toolbar or the Sites tab.
The toolbar provides a button (&amp;ldquo;New Session&amp;rdquo;) which allows you to start a new session, forcing all outgoing request messages to be without the session tokens set, so the server considers it&amp;rsquo;s a new session.</description>

      <description>Passive Scan ZAP by default passively scans all HTTP messages (requests and responses) sent to the web application being tested.
Passive scanning does not change the requests nor the responses in any way and is therefore safe to use.
Scanning is performed in a background thread to ensure that it does not slow down the exploration of an application.</description>

      <description>Spider The spider is a tool that is used to automatically discover new resources (URLs) on a particular Site. It begins with a list of URLs to visit, called the seeds, which depends on how the Spider is started. The Spider then visits these URLs, it identifies all the hyperlinks in the page and adds them to the list of URLs to visit and the process continues recursively as long as new resources are found.</description>

In &amp;rsquo;traditional&amp;rsquo; web applications the structure of the application is typically defined by the URL paths and the data is contained in the URL parameters and POST data.</description>

A request can have multiple tags associated with it.
Tags can be added and changed using the Manage History Tags dialog.
They can also be automatically added via Passive scanning - this allows you to automatically tag pages which match a particular regular expression.</description>

      <description>I’ve always had side projects but at that time I had never contributed to open source. I decided it was a good time to start contributing, so I looked around for an open source security tool with an active community.
Unfortunately I couldn’t find one.
OWASP had WebScarab, but I didn’t really get on with that, and in any case development on that seemed to have stopped.</description>

      <description>In 2009 I was a Java developer / team leader and led a small team which developed an online service for a major accounting software company.
As this service was considered to be security critical I insisted that an external pentest team was hired to ensure the software was suitably secure.</description>

      <description>While I was still finalising the first ZAP release someone else beat me to it 😟.
After years of being neglected, Paros was also forked by Axel Neumann who called his version AndiParos.
I&amp;rsquo;ll have to admit that I was very disheartened and seriously considered abandoning my plans for ZAP.</description>

      <description>I find naming things hard. It is easier if the tool has a very specific purpose, but ZAP has lots of uses.
When I was a developer I always wrote command line scripts. If I thought I might need them again then I would call them something sensible, something that would help me find them again.</description>

      <description>Code Formatting The ZAP code must conform to standard formatting rules - if any changes do not conform then they will fail the build.
Fortunately you do not have to worry about these too much - just run the task: ./gradlew spotlessApply.
Linting While not currently mandatory, we do recommend running SonarLint against any changes you make and fixing anything that it reports.</description>

      <description>ZAP stores its session data in an HSQLDB file database. There is also experimental support for other database engines.
Connecting to a Session Database Since ZAP locks its session file, it is only possible to view or modify the database when ZAP doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the session open. Session files are usually stored under session/ in the default directory.</description>

      <description>We at we45 and our training venture, AppSecEngineer use and train on ZAP extensively. We strongly believe OWASP ZAP to be the most programmable DAST tool in its class, regardless of commercial or OSS alternatives.
One of the things we do with our clients is to implement continuous DAST scanning as part of their DevSecOps initiatives.</description>

      <description>At OBS, we strive continually to bring our customers peace of mind with strengthened and reinforced application security.
As part of automating our web application and API security, we chose to deploy OWASP ZAP as one of our Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) technologies. This DevSecOps approach helps our developers and engineering teams to detect vulnerabilities, including the OWASP Top Ten Web and API, in CI/CD pipelines before releasing our solutions.</description>

      <description>At Banzai Cloud we use our dast-operator which leverages OWASP ZAP to run baseline scans against the services we deploy on the K8S cluster. This operator deploys OWASP ZAP to the K8S cluster and initiates automated security testing for web applications and APIs based on OpenAPI definitions. Besides the operator responsible for starting the scan against a service, it can prevent opening a vulnerable service to outside.</description>

      <description>This may look like a long list of rules but hopefully many of them are just good development practice.
If you are just getting started with ZAP development then do not worry to much about them, but if you plan to make bigger contributions then you should check them before making too many changes that you might need to rework.</description>

      <description>With the increasing number of web application security breaches, it is essential to keep your web application secure at all times. Furthermore having security integrated into your CI/CD pipeline (DevSecOps) will become a lifesaver if you are actively developing the application. To cater to this need ZAP provides a baseline scan feature to find common security faults in a web application without doing any active attacks.</description>

      <description>Some vulnerabilities can only be found by sending payloads that cause a callback to the tester. One example is XXE vulnerabilities when the XML rendering result is not available to the user. ZAP can find these vulnerabilities that depend on SSRF detection but the target system needs to be able to reach the ZAP callback endpoint.</description>

      <description>We have just released a new feature for ZAP that allows you to launch browsers from within ZAP. The browsers are automatically configured to proxy via ZAP and ignore certificate warnings, making it much easier for people to get started with ZAP as well as for more experienced users who want to use ZAP with a variety of browsers.</description>

      <description>The previous ZAP blog post explained how you could Explore APIs with ZAP.
This blog post goes one step further, and explains how you can both explore and perform security scanning of APIs using ZAP from the command line.
This allows you to easily automate the scanning of your APIs.</description>

      <guid>/blog/2017-04-03-exploring-apis-with-zap/</guid>
      <description>APIs can be challenging for security testing for a variety of reasons.
The first problem you will encounter is how to effectively explore an API - most APIs cannot be explored using browsing or standard spidering techniques.
However many APIs are described using technologies such as:
SOAP OpenAPI / Swagger These standards define the API endpoints and can be imported into ZAP using 2 optional add-ons.</description>

      <title>Introducing the JxBrowser add-on for ZAP</title>

      <description>As modern web applications are increasing their reliance on JavaScript, security tools that do not understand JavaScript will not be able to work effectively with them. ZAP already has components like the Ajax Spider and DOM XSS scanner that work by launching browsers and controlling them via Selenium, and we are planning to make much more use of browsers in the future.</description>

      <description>Using ZAP during the development process is now easier than ever. We are proud to present the Jenkins plugin, it extends the functionality of the ZAP security tool into a CI Environment.
The process explained A Jenkins CI Build step initializes ZAP Traffic flows (Regression Pack) through ZAP (Web Proxy) ZAP modifies requests to include Vulnerability Tests Target Application/Server sends Response back through ZAP ZAP sends reporting data back to Jenkins Jenkins publishes and archives the report(s) Jenkins creates JIRA tickets for the alerts The ZAP Jenkins plugin makes use of the readily available and diverse ZAP API, allowing you to use the same session files and scan policy profiles between ZAP and the Jenkins plugin, so they can be interchangeably loaded.</description>

      <description>Unit tests are wonderful things, but they are painful to add to a mature project that doesn’t have enough of them. We would love to have more ZAP unit tests, and we are therefore launching a Unit Test Bounty program, where we pay for unit tests for specific areas of the ZAP codebase.</description>

      <description>At OWASP AppSec EU in Amsterdam this year I announced ZAP as a Service (ZaaS).
The slides are here and the video will hopefully be available soon.
The idea behind this development is to enhance ZAP so that it can be run in a ‘server’ mode.
This is different to the current ‘daemon’ mode in that it will be designed to be a long running, highly scalable, distributed service accessed by multiple users with different roles.</description>

The previous post in this series is: Hacking ZAP #3 - Passive scan rules
Active scan rules are another relatively simple way to enhance ZAP. Active scan rules attack the server, and therefore are only run when explicitly invoked by the user.</description>

      <description>Welcome to a series of blog posts aimed at helping you “hack the ZAP source code”.
The previous post in this series is: Hacking ZAP #2 - Getting Started
One of the easiest ways to enhance ZAP is to write new passive scan rules.
Passive scan rules are used to warn the user of potential vulnerabilities that can be detected passively - they are not allowed to make any new requests or manipulate the requests or responses in any way.</description>

      <description>We are getting close to releasing the next major version of ZAP.
As there are so many changes we&amp;rsquo;ve decided to go to version 2.0.0 rather than 1.5, and some of the biggest changes have come about thanks to the Google Summer of Code (GSoC).
This is the first year in which ZAP has taken part in the GSoC, and it has been a resounding success.</description>

      <description>These are the concepts that you will need to understand in order to configure authentication in ZAP.
Contexts ZAP contexts are a way of relating a set of URLs together. You can define any contexts you like, but it is expected that a context will correspond to a web application.</description>

      <description>Authentication is a key way of restricting access to an app. Some authentication mechanisms also make it significantly harder to use tools like ZAP, even for those people who have permission to use them.
Test in a Safe Environment Testing with valid credentials in a production environment is a really bad idea.</description>

      <guid>/docs/authentication/manual-auth/</guid>
      <description>If you are just performing manual testing then authentication is generally easier.
With manual testing you should be exploring the target app manually with a browser that is proxying through ZAP. In this case you can just use the valid credentials in the browser and in most cases you will be logged in.</description>

      <description>If ZAP is handling authentication then it needs to handle sessions as well - logging in is of no use if ZAP does not maintain the session as the target app will just treat ZAP as being unauthenticated.
Session management configuration is part of a ZAP context.</description>

      <description>Automation Framework - delay Job This job waits for a specified time unless one of a specific set of conditions are met.
It can be used to wait for regression tests being proxied through ZAP in order to explore your application more thoroughly.
The time parameter supports the formats hh:mm:ss, mm:ss and ss, so &amp;ldquo;5&amp;rdquo; is 5 seconds, &amp;ldquo;1:30&amp;rdquo; is one minute and 30 seconds and &amp;ldquo;2:20:30&amp;rdquo; is 2 hours, 20 minutes and 30 seconds.</description>

      <description>Buffer overflow errors are characterized by the overwriting of memory spaces of the background web process, which should have never been modified intentionally or unintentionally. Overwriting values of the IP (Instruction Pointer), BP (Base Pointer) and other registers causes exceptions, segmentation faults, and other process errors to occur. Usually these errors end execution of the application in an unexpected way.</description>

      <description>This check identifies responses where the HTTP Content-Type header declares a charset different from the charset defined by the body of the HTML or XML.

All of these providers provide metadata via an internal unroutable IP address &amp;lsquo;169.254.169.254&amp;rsquo; - this can be exposed by incorrectly configured NGINX servers and accessed by using this IP address in the Host header field.</description>

      <description>Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page — covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.</description>

      <description>Scan rules are a good place to start contributing as they are relatively self contained and do not require you to understand the rest of the ZAP code base. They are also a great way to learn more about security.
Finding Something to Improve If you already know of a vulnerability that ZAP doesn&amp;rsquo;t find, or a False Positive that ZAP reports (for example as you have run ZAP against one of your own apps) then you can skip this part.</description>

      <description>This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where cookie parameters might be controlled. This is called a cookie poisoning attack, and becomes exploitable when an attacker can manipulate the cookie in various ways.

      <description>This CORS misconfiguration could allow an attacker to perform AJAX queries to the vulnerable website from a malicious page loaded by the victim&amp;rsquo;s user agent. In order to perform authenticated AJAX queries, the server must specify the header &amp;ldquo;Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&amp;rdquo; header must be set to null or the malicious page&amp;rsquo;s domain.</description>

      <description>By manipulating the padding on an encrypted string, an attacker is able to generate an error message that indicates a likely &amp;lsquo;padding oracle&amp;rsquo; vulnerability. Such a vulnerability can affect any application or framework that uses encryption improperly, such as some versions of ASP.net, Java Server Faces, and Mono. An attacker may exploit this issue to decrypt data and recover encryption keys, potentially viewing and modifying confidential data.</description>

      <description>A request that was originally observed as a POST was also accepted as a GET. This issue does not represent a security weakness unto itself, however, it may facilitate simplification of other attacks. For example if the original POST is subject to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), then this finding may indicate that a simplified (GET based) XSS may also be possible.</description>

      <description>Overview This guide is intended to serve as a basic introduction for using ZAP to perform security testing, even if you don’t have a background in security testing. To that end, some security testing concepts and terminology is included but this document is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to either ZAP or security testing.</description>

      <description>If you can generate an authentication token (e.g. to use in a header or cookie) and you know that your app will not invalidate it while you are using ZAP then one option is to handle authentication yourself.
In this case you take on the responsibility for handling the authentication and session handling.</description>

      <description>HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP) attacks consist of injecting encoded query string delimiters into other existing parameters. If a web application does not properly sanitize the user input, a malicious user can compromise the logic of the application to perform either client-side or server-side attacks. One consequence of HPP attacks is that the attacker can potentially override existing hard-coded HTTP parameters to modify the behavior of an application, bypass input validation checkpoints, and access and possibly exploit variables that may be out of direct reach.</description>

      <description>Open redirects are one of the OWASP 2010 Top Ten vulnerabilities. This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where open redirects might be possible. Open redirects occur when an application allows user-supplied input (e.g. http://nottrusted.com) to control an offsite redirect. This is generally a pretty accurate way to find where 301 or 302 redirects could be exploited by spammers or phishing attacks.</description>

      <description>Permissions Policy Header is an added layer of security that helps to restrict from unauthorized access or usage of browser/client features by web resources. This policy ensures the user privacy by limiting or specifying the features of the browsers can be used by the web resources. Permissions Policy provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to limit which features of browsers can be used by the page such as camera, microphone, location, full screen etc.</description>

      <description>It may be possible to enumerate usernames, based on differing HTTP responses when valid and invalid usernames are provided. This would greatly increase the probability of success of password brute-forcing attacks against the system. Note that false positives may sometimes be minimised by increasing the &amp;lsquo;Attack Strength&amp;rsquo; Option in ZAP.</description>

      <description>The cache-control header has not been set properly or is missing, allowing the browser and proxies to cache content.

      <description>The web server is configured to serve responses to ambiguous URLs in a manner that is likely to lead to confusion about the correct &amp;ldquo;relative path&amp;rdquo; for the URL. Resources (CSS, images, etc.) are also specified in the page response using relative, rather than absolute URLs. In an attack, if the web browser parses the &amp;ldquo;cross-content&amp;rdquo; response in a permissive manner, or can be tricked into permissively parsing the &amp;ldquo;cross-content&amp;rdquo; response, using techniques such as framing, then the web browser may be fooled into interpreting HTML as CSS (or other content types), leading to an XSS vulnerability.</description>

      <description>This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where Content-Type or meta tag charset declarations might be user-controlled. Such charset declarations should always be declared by the application. If an attacker can control the response charset, they could manipulate the HTML to perform XSS or other attacks.</description>

      <description>The server is leaking information through the X-ChromeLogger-Data (or X-ChromePhp-Data) response header. The content of such headers can be customized by the developer, however it is not uncommon to find: server file system locations, vhost declarations, etc.</description>

      <description>The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to &amp;rsquo;nosniff&amp;rsquo;. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type. Current (early 2014) and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type (if one is set), rather than performing MIME-sniffing.</description>

      <description>This technique takes advantage of a feature of XML to build documents dynamically at the time of processing. An XML message can either provide data explicitly or by pointing to an URI where the data exists. In the attack technique, external entities may replace the entity value with malicious data, alternate referrals or may compromise the security of the data the server/XML application has access to.</description>

      <description>XPath Injection is an attack technique used to exploit applications that construct XPath (XML Path Language) queries from user-supplied input to query or navigate XML documents. It can be used directly by an application to query an XML document, as part of a larger operation such as applying an XSLT transformation to an XML document, or applying an XQuery to an XML document.</description>

      <description>The ZAP API scan is a script that is available in the ZAP Docker images.
It is tuned for performing scans against APIs defined by OpenAPI, SOAP, or GraphQL via either a local file or a URL.
It imports the definition that you specify and then runs an Active Scan against the URLs found.</description>

      <description>The ZAP Baseline scan is a script that is available in the ZAP Docker images.
It runs the ZAP spider against the specified target for (by default) 1 minute and then waits for the passive scanning to complete before reporting the results.
This means that the script doesn&amp;rsquo;t perform any actual &amp;lsquo;attacks&amp;rsquo; and will run for a relatively short period of time (a few minutes at most).</description>

      <description>The ZAP full scan is a script that is available in the ZAP Docker images.
It runs the ZAP spider against the specified target (by default with no time limit) followed by an optional ajax spider scan and then a full active scan before reporting the results.
This means that the script does perform actual &amp;lsquo;attacks&amp;rsquo; and can potentially run for a long period of time.</description>
