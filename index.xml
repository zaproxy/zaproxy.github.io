      <description>Active Scan Active scanning attempts to find potential vulnerabilities by using known attacks against the selected targets.
Active scanning is an attack on those targets.
You should NOT use it on web applications that you do not own.
In order to facilitate identifying ZAP traffic and Web Application Firewall exceptions, ZAP is accompanied by a script &amp;ldquo;AddZapHeader.</description>

      <description>OK, so this question doesn&amp;rsquo;t get asked all the time, but it does come up every so often.
So here&amp;rsquo;s the official response:
Firstly, do you really need ZAP rewritten?
ZAP supports all of the JSR 223 scripting languages, so you can already extend ZAP in a very wide range of scripting languages, including JavaScript, Jython, and Jruby.</description>

      <description>We rely on people like yourself to translate ZAP into other languages.
If your language is not available then it means that we, the developers, unfortunately don&amp;rsquo;t speak your language well enough to translate it and no one else has volunteered.
However you can help :)
Get in touch with us if you want to translate ZAP into another language, we&amp;rsquo;d love to hear from you!</description>

      <description>ZAP doesn&amp;rsquo;t just throw a load of payloads at a target to see what happens :)
The payloads are targeted based on the responses to other payloads so that it hopefully zeros in on specific vulnerabilities.
However there a various options:
Try out the custom payloads add-on which is supported by some of the existing rules Change the existing rules to improve them - this blog post is a good place to start: Hacking ZAP: Active Scan Rules - if you do improve them then please submit pull requests :) Write new rules to do whatever you want - this gives you full control, but could be a bit daunting to start with Tweak the User defined attacks.</description>

By default when you use the ZAP spider and active scanner then ZAP will access all of the URLs, forms, and functionality it can find. If one of those results in your application sending emails then someone is going to get a LOT of emails.</description>

      <description>False positives are where ZAP raises alerts for things that are not really vulnerabilities. You should make sure that you understand the potential vulnerability being reported and manually test it before concluding that it is not a real vulnerability.

      <description>False Negatives are where ZAP fails to identify an issue when it should.
Reporting these problems to us for passive scan rules is straightforward - just let us know the full request and/or response that ZAP should have raised the problem for.
Reporting problems with active scan rules is a bit more tricky, as ZAP will potentially send several requests to detect a specific problem and we need to know how your application responded to each one.</description>

      <description>Scan rules are defined in add-ons so they can be updated and published whenever they are improved.
However this may be less frequently than you might expect, and there are good reasons for that.
Some security tools focus on finding known vulnerabilities in known applications. New vulnerabilities are being found all of the time so the rules for these tools need to be frequently updated.</description>

      <description>Proxying (and therefore passive scanning) requests via ZAP is completely safe and legal, it just allows you to see whats going on.
Spidering is a bit more dangerous. It could cause problems depending on how your application works.
Note that there is an Spider option to not use POST requests - this may be safer but is also likely to reduce the effectiveness of the Spider.</description>

      <description>ZAP is a free tool designed to help everyone secure their own websites. Unfortunately this means that other people can use it to attack your website as well.
ZAP is not designed to be a covert tool - it uses various variations of &amp;ldquo;ZAP&amp;rdquo; in its attacks, so if someone does use ZAP to attack your site then this should be apparent in your web server logs.</description>

      <description>If you run ZAP multiple times against a target then you may well find that the results are subtly different even though the target has not changed.
This is not unusual, and we do not consider this a significant problem.
In our experience it is usually all down to how the application is explored - the traditional and ajax spiders seem to be sensitive to small changes, including things like network speed.</description>

      <description>ZAP has no problems scanning applications running on localhost, however there are a couple of things you need to be aware of.
By default ZAP listens on port 8080. If your app also listens on 8080 then you&amp;rsquo;ll need to change one of them to listen on a different port - it&amp;rsquo;s probably easier to change ZAP using the Options Local Proxies screen, remember to change your browser&amp;rsquo;s proxy settings as well: Configuring Proxies.</description>

      <description>First of all try checking the &amp;lsquo;Enable unsafe SSL/TLS renegotiation&amp;rsquo; checkbox in the Certificate Options screen and trying again.
Second check if you&amp;rsquo;ve enabled SSLv2Hello in the outbound connection options. If so, disable SSLv2Hello and reload the content to see if the issue is resolved.
If this doesn&amp;rsquo;t help and an HTTPS site reports a handshake failure then try installing the &amp;lsquo;Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files&amp;rsquo;:</description>

      <description>There are a number of ways to accomplish selective proxying.
1 - Via a Browser Add-on/Extension Such as FoxyProxy: https://getfoxyproxy.org/ 2 - Via Global Excludes Leveraging Global Excludes you can specify URLs that ZAP should not intercept. 3 - Via a PAC (Proxy Auto-Config) File You can create your own PAC (Proxy Auto-Config) file and dynamically set proxying as you need, then point your browser at it on your harddrive using the file:/// scheme.</description>

      <guid>/faq/why-cant-zap-connect-to-my-website/</guid>
      <description>This is usually not a ZAP problem.
Is your web application actually running?
Can you connect to it using the IP address rather than the FQDN or hostname?
Can you connect to your application from the same machine using another tool like curl?
If you are using one of the ZAP Docker images then be aware that using Docker will change the networking.</description>

      <description>API ZAP provides an Application Programming Interface (API) which allows you to interact with ZAP programmatically.
The API is available in JSON, HTML and XML formats.
A simple web UI which allows you to explore and use the API is available via the URL http://zap/ when you are proxying via ZAP, or via the host and port ZAP is listening on, eg http://localhost:8080/.</description>

      <description>This seems to come up on various Linux distros from time to time. For example: https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/3051
The following suggestions may let you work past the issue.
Try starting ZAP from the command line instead of starting it from a shortcut (such as a Plasma/KDE button, dock icon, etc.) Try adding the following to /etc/environment: _JAVA_OPTIONS=&#39;-Dawt.</description>

      <guid>/faq/how-can-i-run-zap-with-a-high-dpi-display/</guid>
      <description>If ZAP is displayed in a really tiny window then it&amp;rsquo;s probably because you have a high DPI display.
The solution is easy - use Java 9+
If you need to have multiple versions of Java on Windows then you may find it difficult to specify which one should be used.</description>

      <guid>/faq/how-can-i-use-the-zap-api-in-my-own-regression-tests/</guid>
      <description>You can use ZAP to perform security regression tests on your own products.
Note that this answer is very basic and WILL need to be improved ;)
You need to have installed Java and ZAP.
To launch ZAP from a Java program you can do something like:
ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder(&amp;#34;/home/myuser/fullpath/ZAP 2.</description>

      <guid>/faq/how-can-you-use-zap-to-scan-apis/</guid>
      <description>ZAP understands API formats like JSON and XML and so can be used to scan APIs.
The problem is usually how to effectively explore the APIs.
There are various options:
If your API has an OpenAPI/Swagger definition then you can import it using the OpenAPI add-on. If your API uses GraphQL then you can explore it using the GraphQL add-on.</description>

      <guid>/faq/how-can-zap-test-sites-that-use-certificate-pinning/</guid>
      <description>Certificate pinning also known as Public Key Pinning &amp;ldquo;is a mechanism for sites to specify which certificate authorities have issued valid certs for that site, and for user-agents to reject TLS connections to those sites if the certificate is not issued by a known-good CA.&amp;rdquo;
Sites that use certificate pinning will typically not be loaded in your browser if you are proxying it through ZAP.</description>

      <description>The information in this FAQ is based on details from: This user group thread
The Vaadin framework makes heavy use of JavaScript, so it seems the Ajax Spider is the way to go.
As you work to figure things out and get them configured correctly it makes sense to starting by proxying your browser through ZAP, identifying the http session and then flagging it as the &amp;lsquo;active session&amp;rsquo; before starting the Ajax Spider.</description>

The missing Ids do not refer to &amp;lsquo;hidden&amp;rsquo; requests that ZAP is making.
Instead those requests (which are not sent at all) are generated by ZAP for &amp;ldquo;internal&amp;rdquo; use only.</description>

      <description> Automation Framework - Job Outcome Tests The automation framework supports testing the job outcomes based on conditions that you can set in the YAML file.
The currently supported tests are:
alert - Alert tests - validate the presence or absence of specified alerts monitor - Monitor tests - allow you to stop long running jobs based on statistic thresholds stats - Statistics tests - test any of the statistics maintained by ZAP url - URL tests - validate the presence/absence of a URL and it’s specific expressions in the HTTP response/request </description>

      <description>Breakpoints A breakpoint allows you to intercept a request from your browser and to change it before is is submitted to the web application you are testing.
You can also change the responses received from the application
The request or response will be displayed in the Break tab which allows you to change disabled or hidden fields, and will allow you to bypass client side validation (often enforced using javascript).</description>

Images If ZAP processes images.
Show (local) CONNECT requests If the HTTP CONNECT requests received by ZAP&amp;rsquo;s proxies should be persisted in the current session and shown in the History tab. The default is to not show those requests, they happen frequently (in preparation for TLS/SSL, WebSocket&amp;hellip; connections) and, unless inspecting the behaviour of the client application, are not (usually) of much interest.</description>

      <description>Passive Scan ZAP by default passively scans all HTTP messages (requests and responses) sent to the web application being tested.
Passive scanning does not change the requests nor the responses in any way and is therefore safe to use.
Scanning is performed in a background thread to ensure that it does not slow down the exploration of an application.</description>

      <description>Statistics ZAP maintains statistics which can help you understand what is really happening when interacting with large applications.
The statistics are available via the API and can be also sent to a Statsd server when configured via the Options Statistics screen.
The full set of statistics maintained by the ZAP core and add-ons are maintained on the ZAP website: Internal Statistics.</description>

      <description>Structural Modifiers Structural Modifiers are controls which change how ZAP represents the structure of the application.
The Sites Tree is ZAP&amp;rsquo;s representation of the application.
If it is not a good representation of the structure then ZAP will not be able to attack the application effectively.
There are currently 2 types of Structural Modifiers:</description>

      <description>I’ve always had side projects but at that time I had never contributed to open source. I decided it was a good time to start contributing, so I looked around for an open source security tool with an active community.
Unfortunately I couldn’t find one.
OWASP had WebScarab, but I didn’t really get on with that, and in any case development on that seemed to have stopped.</description>

      <description>In 2009 I was a Java developer / team leader and led a small team which developed an online service for a major accounting software company.
As this service was considered to be security critical I insisted that an external pentest team was hired to ensure the software was suitably secure.</description>

      <description>While I was still finalising the first ZAP release someone else beat me to it 😟.
After years of being neglected, Paros was also forked by Axel Neumann who called his version AndiParos.
I&amp;rsquo;ll have to admit that I was very disheartened and seriously considered abandoning my plans for ZAP.</description>

      <description>I find naming things hard. It is easier if the tool has a very specific purpose, but ZAP has lots of uses.
When I was a developer I always wrote command line scripts. If I thought I might need them again then I would call them something sensible, something that would help me find them again.</description>

      <description>Code Formatting The ZAP code must conform to standard formatting rules - if any changes do not conform then they will fail the build.
Fortunately you do not have to worry about these too much - just run the task: ./gradlew spotlessApply.
Linting While not currently mandatory, we do recommend running SonarLint against any changes you make and fixing anything that it reports.</description>

      <description>ZAP stores its session data in an HSQLDB file database. There is also experimental support for other database engines.
Connecting to a Session Database Since ZAP locks its session file, it is only possible to view or modify the database when ZAP doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the session open. Session files are usually stored under session/ in the default directory.</description>

      <description>At Banzai Cloud we use our dast-operator which leverages OWASP ZAP to run baseline scans against the services we deploy on the K8S cluster. This operator deploys OWASP ZAP to the K8S cluster and initiates automated security testing for web applications and APIs based on OpenAPI definitions. Besides the operator responsible for starting the scan against a service, it can prevent opening a vulnerable service to outside.</description>

      <description>With the popularity of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) there comes the need to secure their use so that they are not misused because of bad configuration, older libraries, or buggy implementations. So the JWT Support add-on is used to find such vulnerabilities and this blog explains on how to use it.</description>

      <title>Introducing the GraphQL Add-on for ZAP</title>

      <guid>/blog/2020-08-28-introducing-the-graphql-add-on-for-zap/</guid>
      <description>GraphQL Schemas can be very large and testing them can be a very time-consuming process. Currently, there is a lack of tools that allow developers to launch and automate attacks on these endpoints. The GraphQL add-on for ZAP intends to fill this gap.
The add-on is still in an early stage, so the range of its functionality is limited.</description>

      <guid>/blog/2020-05-15-dynamic-application-security-testing-with-zap-and-github-actions/</guid>
      <description>ZAP full scan GitHub action provides free dynamic application security testing (DAST) of your web applications. DAST is also known as black-box testing, which allows ZAP to identify potential vulnerabilities in your web applications. We previously introduced the ZAP baseline scan GitHub action to passively identify potential alerts in a web application.</description>

      <description>Did you know that you or your company/organization could customize the generic details of the alerts that ZAP raises?
Alerts raised by ZAP contain a variety of information, some generic, some specific to the issue at hand. Specific details may include things such as URL, parameter, values, etc. While generic details include things like a description, solution, and links to related background material and resources.</description>

      <description>With the increasing number of web application security breaches, it is essential to keep your web application secure at all times. Furthermore having security integrated into your CI/CD pipeline (DevSecOps) will become a lifesaver if you are actively developing the application. To cater to this need ZAP provides a baseline scan feature to find common security faults in a web application without doing any active attacks.</description>

      <description>I’ve stated that ZAP is the world’s most popular free and open source web application scanner on stage at security conferences around the world for many years. No one has ever contradicted me so it must be true :)
However I’ve started to wonder if ZAP is actually more popular than most if not all of the commercial scanners as well?</description>

      <description>Some vulnerabilities can only be found by sending payloads that cause a callback to the tester. One example is XXE vulnerabilities when the XML rendering result is not available to the user. ZAP can find these vulnerabilities that depend on SSRF detection but the target system needs to be able to reach the ZAP callback endpoint.</description>

      <description>This document gives an overview of the automatic and manual components provided by OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) that are recommended for testing each of the OWASP Top Ten Project 2017 risks.
For the latest Top Ten see ZAPping the OWASP Top 10 (2021)
Note that the OWASP Top Ten Project risks cover a wide range of underlying vulnerabilities, some of which are not really possible to test for in a completely automated way.</description>

      <description>We have just released a new feature for ZAP that allows you to launch browsers from within ZAP. The browsers are automatically configured to proxy via ZAP and ignore certificate warnings, making it much easier for people to get started with ZAP as well as for more experienced users who want to use ZAP with a variety of browsers.</description>

      <description>The previous ZAP blog post explained how you could Explore APIs with ZAP.
This blog post goes one step further, and explains how you can both explore and perform security scanning of APIs using ZAP from the command line.
This allows you to easily automate the scanning of your APIs.</description>

      <guid>/blog/2017-04-03-exploring-apis-with-zap/</guid>
      <description>APIs can be challenging for security testing for a variety of reasons.
The first problem you will encounter is how to effectively explore an API - most APIs cannot be explored using browsing or standard spidering techniques.
However many APIs are described using technologies such as:
SOAP OpenAPI / Swagger These standards define the API endpoints and can be imported into ZAP using 2 optional add-ons.</description>

      <description>As modern web applications are increasing their reliance on JavaScript, security tools that do not understand JavaScript will not be able to work effectively with them. ZAP already has components like the Ajax Spider and DOM XSS scanner that work by launching browsers and controlling them via Selenium, and we are planning to make much more use of browsers in the future.</description>

      <description>Using ZAP during the development process is now easier than ever. We are proud to present the Jenkins plugin, it extends the functionality of the ZAP security tool into a CI Environment.
The process explained A Jenkins CI Build step initializes ZAP Traffic flows (Regression Pack) through ZAP (Web Proxy) ZAP modifies requests to include Vulnerability Tests Target Application/Server sends Response back through ZAP ZAP sends reporting data back to Jenkins Jenkins publishes and archives the report(s) Jenkins creates JIRA tickets for the alerts The ZAP Jenkins plugin makes use of the readily available and diverse ZAP API, allowing you to use the same session files and scan policy profiles between ZAP and the Jenkins plugin, so they can be interchangeably loaded.</description>

      <description>At OWASP AppSec EU in Amsterdam this year I announced ZAP as a Service (ZaaS).
The slides are here and the video will hopefully be available soon.
The idea behind this development is to enhance ZAP so that it can be run in a ‘server’ mode.
This is different to the current ‘daemon’ mode in that it will be designed to be a long running, highly scalable, distributed service accessed by multiple users with different roles.</description>

The previous post in this series is: Hacking ZAP #2 - Getting Started
One of the easiest ways to enhance ZAP is to write new passive scan rules.
Passive scan rules are used to warn the user of potential vulnerabilities that can be detected passively - they are not allowed to make any new requests or manipulate the requests or responses in any way.</description>

      <description>We are getting close to releasing the next major version of ZAP.
As there are so many changes we&amp;rsquo;ve decided to go to version 2.0.0 rather than 1.5, and some of the biggest changes have come about thanks to the Google Summer of Code (GSoC).
This is the first year in which ZAP has taken part in the GSoC, and it has been a resounding success.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling with the question of ZAP releases.
We&amp;rsquo;ve made loads of enhancements to ZAP recently, and I want them to be available to as wide an audience as possible.
But I also want to make sure our &amp;lsquo;full&amp;rsquo; releases remain as robust and stable as possible.</description>

      <description>These are the concepts that you will need to understand in order to configure authentication in ZAP.
Contexts ZAP contexts are a way of relating a set of URLs together. You can define any contexts you like, but it is expected that a context will correspond to a web application.</description>

      <guid>/docs/authentication/make-your-life-easier/</guid>
      <description>Authentication is a key way of restricting access to an app. Some authentication mechanisms also make it significantly harder to use tools like ZAP, even for those people who have permission to use them.
Test in a Safe Environment Testing with valid credentials in a production environment is a really bad idea.</description>

      <guid>/docs/authentication/manual-auth/</guid>
      <description>If you are just performing manual testing then authentication is generally easier.
With manual testing you should be exploring the target app manually with a browser that is proxying through ZAP. In this case you can just use the valid credentials in the browser and in most cases you will be logged in.</description>

      <guid>/docs/authentication/session-handling/</guid>
      <description>If ZAP is handling authentication then it needs to handle sessions as well - logging in is of no use if ZAP does not maintain the session as the target app will just treat ZAP as being unauthenticated.
Session management configuration is part of a ZAP context.</description>

      <description>Automation Framework - delay Job This job waits for a specified time unless one of a specific set of conditions are met.
It can be used to wait for regression tests being proxied through ZAP in order to explore your application more thoroughly.
The time parameter supports the formats hh:mm:ss, mm:ss and ss, so &amp;ldquo;5&amp;rdquo; is 5 seconds, &amp;ldquo;1:30&amp;rdquo; is one minute and 30 seconds and &amp;ldquo;2:20:30&amp;rdquo; is 2 hours, 20 minutes and 30 seconds.</description>

      <description>Automation Framework - requestor Job This job sends specifically crafted requests to a target url, with a custom request method and body.

      <description>Buffer overflow errors are characterized by the overwriting of memory spaces of the background web process, which should have never been modified intentionally or unintentionally. Overwriting values of the IP (Instruction Pointer), BP (Base Pointer) and other registers causes exceptions, segmentation faults, and other process errors to occur. Usually these errors end execution of the application in an unexpected way.</description>

      <description>This check identifies responses where the HTTP Content-Type header declares a charset different from the charset defined by the body of the HTML or XML. When there&amp;rsquo;s a charset mismatch between the HTTP header and content body Web browsers can be forced into an undesirable content-sniffing mode to determine the content&amp;rsquo;s correct character set.</description>

      <description>The Cloud Metadata Attack attempts to abuse a misconfigured NGINX server in order to access the instance metadata maintained by cloud service providers such as AWS, GCP and Azure. All of these providers provide metadata via an internal unroutable IP address &amp;lsquo;169.254.169.254&amp;rsquo; - this can be exposed by incorrectly configured NGINX servers and accessed by using this IP address in the Host header field.</description>

      <description>Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page — covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.</description>

This can be one of the most rewarding ways to contribute to ZAP - just look at the ZAP Student Hall of Fame to see how many students have made major contributions to ZAP and where it&amp;rsquo;s led them.
You don&amp;rsquo;t have to be a student of course, anyone who know is interested will be able to help us out with the ZAP code base.</description>

      <description>Documentation is very important, and while we have tried to make the ZAP documentation as useful as possible we know that it still needs to be improved.
The latest ZAP docs are now all available on this site but the source of those pages does vary.
Website Pages The source for the main website pages is under https://github.</description>

      <description>If you are having problems with ZAP then it is always best to first look at the FAQ: Somethings not working. What should I do?.
In particular:
Check the Frequently Asked Questions Search the ZAP User Group posts Search the existing issues Raising an Issue If you have found a new bug then raise a new issue.</description>

      <description>If you run a technical group like an OWASP Local Chapter then how about running a ZAP Hackathon?
You can do it all on your own but if you reach out to the ZAP Team (either directly or via the User Group) then we will be delighted to help you as much as we can.</description>

      <description>Scan rules are a good place to start contributing as they are relatively self contained and do not require you to understand the rest of the ZAP code base. They are also a great way to learn more about security.
Finding Something to Improve If you already know of a vulnerability that ZAP doesn&amp;rsquo;t find, or a False Positive that ZAP reports (for example as you have run ZAP against one of your own apps) then you can skip this part.</description>

      <description>ZAP is designed to attack real world apps, so we do not tune ZAP just to score better against vulnerable test apps. However, such test apps are still very worthwhile and can be representative of real world apps.
There are a large number of deliberately vulnerable apps - see the OWASP VWAD project.</description>

      <description>We believe that security tools should be available to everyone, which is why ZAP is one of the very few security tools that is both fully internationalised and translated into many languages.
ZAP Desktop You can help translate the ZAP Desktop via the Crowdin: zaproxy project.
You can signup to Crowdin for free, and if you&amp;rsquo;d like to translate ZAP to a language not on the list then let us know and we&amp;rsquo;ll add it in.</description>

      <description>A cookie has been set without the HttpOnly flag, which means that the cookie can be accessed by JavaScript. If a malicious script can be run on this page then the cookie will be accessible and can be transmitted to another site. If this is a session cookie then session hijacking may be possible.</description>

      <description>This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where cookie parameters might be controlled. This is called a cookie poisoning attack, and becomes exploitable when an attacker can manipulate the cookie in various ways. In some cases this will not be exploitable, however, allowing URL parameters to set cookie values is generally considered a bug.</description>

      <description>Repeated GET requests: drop a different cookie each time, followed by normal request with all cookies to stabilize session, compare responses against original baseline GET. This can reveal areas where cookie based authentication/attributes are not actually enforced.</description>

      <description>A cookie has been set without the SameSite attribute, which means that the cookie can be sent as a result of a &amp;lsquo;cross-site&amp;rsquo; request. The SameSite attribute is an effective counter measure to cross-site request forgery, cross-site script inclusion, and timing attacks.</description>

      <description>This CORS misconfiguration could allow an attacker to perform AJAX queries to the vulnerable website from a malicious page loaded by the victim&amp;rsquo;s user agent. In order to perform authenticated AJAX queries, the server must specify the header &amp;ldquo;Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&amp;rdquo; header must be set to null or the malicious page&amp;rsquo;s domain.</description>

We know that the ZAP authentication documentation needs improving. One of the reasons why it has not been improved is that we are too busy trying to answer authentication questions 😉.</description>

      <description>Docker is a great way to run ZAP in a CI/CD pipeline, but diagnosing problems can be tricky.
ZAP Cannot Connect to the Target If ZAP cannot connect to your target app then the first thing to do is to see if this is a &amp;lsquo;Docker&amp;rsquo; networking issue.</description>

      <description>By manipulating the padding on an encrypted string, an attacker is able to generate an error message that indicates a likely &amp;lsquo;padding oracle&amp;rsquo; vulnerability. Such a vulnerability can affect any application or framework that uses encryption improperly, such as some versions of ASP.net, Java Server Faces, and Mono. An attacker may exploit this issue to decrypt data and recover encryption keys, potentially viewing and modifying confidential data.</description>

      <description>A request that was originally observed as a POST was also accepted as a GET. This issue does not represent a security weakness unto itself, however, it may facilitate simplification of other attacks. For example if the original POST is subject to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), then this finding may indicate that a simplified (GET based) XSS may also be possible.</description>

      <description>If you can generate an authentication token (e.g. to use in a header or cookie) and you know that your app will not invalidate it while you are using ZAP then one option is to handle authentication yourself.
In this case you take on the responsibility for handling the authentication and session handling.</description>

      <description>HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP) attacks consist of injecting encoded query string delimiters into other existing parameters. If a web application does not properly sanitize the user input, a malicious user can compromise the logic of the application to perform either client-side or server-side attacks. One consequence of HPP attacks is that the attacker can potentially override existing hard-coded HTTP parameters to modify the behavior of an application, bypass input validation checkpoints, and access and possibly exploit variables that may be out of direct reach.</description>

      <description>The most common methodology for attackers is to first footprint the target&amp;rsquo;s web presence and enumerate as much information as possible. With this information, the attacker may develop an accurate attack scenario, which will effectively exploit a vulnerability in the software type/version being utilized by the target host.</description>

      <description>Open redirects are one of the OWASP 2010 Top Ten vulnerabilities. This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where open redirects might be possible. Open redirects occur when an application allows user-supplied input (e.g. http://nottrusted.com) to control an offsite redirect. This is generally a pretty accurate way to find where 301 or 302 redirects could be exploited by spammers or phishing attacks.</description>

      <description>Permissions Policy Header is an added layer of security that helps to restrict from unauthorized access or usage of browser/client features by web resources. This policy ensures the user privacy by limiting or specifying the features of the browsers can be used by the web resources. Permissions Policy provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to limit which features of browsers can be used by the page such as camera, microphone, location, full screen etc.</description>

      <description>The web server is configured to serve responses to ambiguous URLs in a manner that is likely to lead to confusion about the correct &amp;ldquo;relative path&amp;rdquo; for the URL. Resources (CSS, images, etc.) are also specified in the page response using relative, rather than absolute URLs. In an attack, if the web browser parses the &amp;ldquo;cross-content&amp;rdquo; response in a permissive manner, or can be tricked into permissively parsing the &amp;ldquo;cross-content&amp;rdquo; response, using techniques such as framing, then the web browser may be fooled into interpreting HTML as CSS (or other content types), leading to an XSS vulnerability.</description>

      <description>Remote File Include (RFI) is an attack technique used to exploit &amp;ldquo;dynamic file include&amp;rdquo; mechanisms in web applications. When web applications take user input (URL, parameter value, etc.) and pass them into file include commands, the web application might be tricked into including remote files with malicious code.</description>

Access to such information may facilitate attackers identifying other vulnerabilities your web/application server is subject to. This information alone, i.e. without a version string, is not very dangerous for the security of a server, nevertheless this information in the response header field is almost always useless and thus just an obsolete attacking vector.</description>

      <description>The following students have completed projects which have significantly improved ZAP.
To qualify for this list students must complete a non trivial project and have their work either included in the ZAP core or in an add-on that has been published on the Marketplace. Projects that are not published by the time the students have finished can still qualify to be included if someone else completes their work and publishes it for them.</description>

      <description>This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where Content-Type or meta tag charset declarations might be user-controlled. Such charset declarations should always be declared by the application. If an attacker can control the response charset, they could manipulate the HTML to perform XSS or other attacks.</description>

      <description>The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to &amp;rsquo;nosniff&amp;rsquo;. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type. Current (early 2014) and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type (if one is set), rather than performing MIME-sniffing.</description>

      <description>This technique takes advantage of a feature of XML to build documents dynamically at the time of processing. An XML message can either provide data explicitly or by pointing to an URI where the data exists. In the attack technique, external entities may replace the entity value with malicious data, alternate referrals or may compromise the security of the data the server/XML application has access to.</description>

      <description>XPath Injection is an attack technique used to exploit applications that construct XPath (XML Path Language) queries from user-supplied input to query or navigate XML documents. It can be used directly by an application to query an XML document, as part of a larger operation such as applying an XSLT transformation to an XML document, or applying an XQuery to an XML document.</description>

      <description>The ZAP API scan is a script that is available in the ZAP Docker images.

      <description>The ZAP Baseline scan is a script that is available in the ZAP Docker images.
It runs the ZAP spider against the specified target for (by default) 1 minute and then waits for the passive scanning to complete before reporting the results.
This means that the script doesn&amp;rsquo;t perform any actual &amp;lsquo;attacks&amp;rsquo; and will run for a relatively short period of time (a few minutes at most).</description>

      <description>The ZAP full scan is a script that is available in the ZAP Docker images.
It runs the ZAP spider against the specified target (by default with no time limit) followed by an optional ajax spider scan and then a full active scan before reporting the results.
This means that the script does perform actual &amp;lsquo;attacks&amp;rsquo; and can potentially run for a long period of time.</description>

      <description>Google Security Crawl Maze is a comprehensive testbed for web security crawlers.
It is available online at https://security-crawl-maze.app/ and the GitHub repo is https://github.com/google/security-crawl-maze It does appear to be being actively maintained and has merged a fix that we submitted.
As long as one of the ZAP spiders finds the relevant page we count that as a pass, but ideally both spiders will find as many of the URLs as possible.</description>
