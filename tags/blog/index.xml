      <description>GraphQL Schemas can be very large and testing them can be a very time-consuming process. Currently, there is a lack of tools that allow developers to launch and automate attacks on these endpoints. The GraphQL add-on for ZAP intends to fill this gap.
The add-on is still in an early stage, so the range of its functionality is limited.</description>

      <description>ZAP full scan GitHub action provides free dynamic application security testing (DAST) of your web applications. DAST is also known as black-box testing, which allows ZAP to identify potential vulnerabilities in your web applications. We previously introduced the ZAP baseline scan GitHub action to passively identify potential alerts in a web application.</description>

      <description>Did you know that you or your company/organization could customize the generic details of the alerts that ZAP raises?
Alerts raised by ZAP contain a variety of information, some generic, some specific to the issue at hand. Specific details may include things such as URL, parameter, values, etc. While generic details include things like a description, solution, and links to related background material and resources.</description>

      <description>With the increasing number of web application security breaches, it is essential to keep your web application secure at all times. Furthermore having security integrated into your CI/CD pipeline (DevSecOps) will become a lifesaver if you are actively developing the application. To cater to this need ZAP provides a baseline scan feature to find common security faults in a web application without doing any active attacks.</description>

      <description>I’ve stated that ZAP is the world’s most popular free and open source web application scanner on stage at security conferences around the world for many years. No one has ever contradicted me so it must be true :)
However I’ve started to wonder if ZAP is actually more popular than most if not all of the commercial scanners as well?</description>

      <guid>/blog/2020-03-09-zap-ssrf-setup/</guid>
      <description>Some vulnerabilities can only be found by sending payloads that cause a callback to the tester. One example is XXE vulnerabilities when the XML rendering result is not available to the user. ZAP can find these vulnerabilities that depend on SSRF detection but the target system needs to be able to reach the ZAP callback endpoint.</description>

      <description>Hello everybody, my name is Alberto Verza, a 23 year student from Spain, and this summer I have participated in Google Summer of Code 2014. My project was the SOAP Scanner add-on for ZAP, in which I worked during all the Program. Let me explain you the features it includes.</description>

      <description>We are getting close to releasing the next major version of ZAP.
As there are so many changes we&amp;rsquo;ve decided to go to version 2.0.0 rather than 1.5, and some of the biggest changes have come about thanks to the Google Summer of Code (GSoC).
This is the first year in which ZAP has taken part in the GSoC, and it has been a resounding success.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling with the question of ZAP releases.
We&amp;rsquo;ve made loads of enhancements to ZAP recently, and I want them to be available to as wide an audience as possible.
But I also want to make sure our &amp;lsquo;full&amp;rsquo; releases remain as robust and stable as possible.</description>
