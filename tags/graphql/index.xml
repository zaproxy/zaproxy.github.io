      <description>&lt;p&gt;GraphQL Schemas can be very large and testing them can be a very time-consuming process. Currently, there is a lack of tools that allow developers to launch and automate attacks on these endpoints. The GraphQL add-on for ZAP intends to fill this gap.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The add-on is still in an early stage, so the range of its functionality is limited. However, you can combine it with existing ZAP functionality to abuse GraphQL endpoints in many different ways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
