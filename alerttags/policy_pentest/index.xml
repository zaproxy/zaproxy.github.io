      <title>Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;No Anti-CSRF tokens were found in a HTML submission form.&#xA;A cross-site request forgery is an attack that involves forcing a victim to send an HTTP request to a target destination without their knowledge or intent in order to perform an action as the victim. The underlying cause is application functionality using predictable URL/form actions in a repeatable way. The nature of the attack is that CSRF exploits the trust that a web site has for a user. By contrast, cross-site scripting (XSS) exploits the trust that a user has for a web site. Like XSS, CSRF attacks are not necessarily cross-site, but they can be. Cross-site request forgery is also known as CSRF, XSRF, one-click attack, session riding, confused deputy, and sea surf.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Authentication Credentials Captured</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An insecure authentication mechanism is in use. This allows an attacker on the network access to the userid and password of the authenticated user. For Basic Authentication, the attacker must merely monitor the network traffic until a Basic Authentication request is received, and then base64 decode the username and password. For Digest Authentication, the attacker has access to the username, and possibly also the password, if the hash (including a nonce) can be successfully cracked, or if a Man-In-The-Middle attack is mounted.&#xA;The attacker eavesdrops on the network until an authentication has completed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The server has responded with a redirect that seems to provide a large response. This may indicate that although the server sent a redirect it also responded with body content (which may include sensitive details, PII, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Buffer overflow errors are characterized by the overwriting of memory spaces of the background web process, which should have never been modified intentionally or unintentionally. Overwriting values of the IP (Instruction Pointer), BP (Base Pointer) and other registers causes exceptions, segmentation faults, and other process errors to occur. Usually these errors end execution of the application in an unexpected way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This check identifies responses where the HTTP Content-Type header declares a charset different from the charset defined by the body of the HTML or XML. When there&amp;rsquo;s a charset mismatch between the HTTP header and content body Web browsers can be forced into an undesirable content-sniffing mode to determine the content&amp;rsquo;s correct character set.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Cloud Metadata Attack attempts to abuse a misconfigured NGINX server in order to access the instance metadata maintained by cloud service providers such as AWS, GCP and Azure.&#xA;All of these providers provide metadata via an internal unroutable IP address &amp;lsquo;169.254.169.254&amp;rsquo; - this can be exposed by incorrectly configured NGINX servers and accessed by using this IP address in the Host header field.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page — covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A cookie has been set without the HttpOnly flag, which means that the cookie can be accessed by JavaScript. If a malicious script can be run on this page then the cookie will be accessible and can be transmitted to another site. If this is a session cookie then session hijacking may be possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where cookie parameters might be controlled. This is called a cookie poisoning attack, and becomes exploitable when an attacker can manipulate the cookie in various ways. In some cases this will not be exploitable, however, allowing URL parameters to set cookie values is generally considered a bug.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any other origins (domain, scheme, or port) than its own from which a browser should permit loading of resources.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This CORS misconfiguration could allow an attacker to perform AJAX queries to the vulnerable website from a malicious page loaded by the victim&amp;rsquo;s user agent.&#xA;In order to perform authenticated AJAX queries, the server must specify the header &amp;ldquo;Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&amp;rdquo; header must be set to null or the malicious page&amp;rsquo;s domain. Even if this misconfiguration doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow authenticated AJAX requests, unauthenticated sensitive content can still be accessed (e.g intranet websites).&#xA;A malicious page can belong to a malicious website but also a trusted website with flaws (e.g XSS, support of HTTP without TLS allowing code injection through MITM, etc).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cross-site Scripting (XSS) is an attack technique that involves echoing attacker-supplied code into a user&amp;rsquo;s browser instance. A browser instance can be a standard web browser client, or a browser object embedded in a software product such as the browser within WinAmp, an RSS reader, or an email client. The code itself is usually written in HTML/JavaScript, but may also extend to VBScript, ActiveX, Java, Flash, or any other browser-supported technology.&#xA;When an attacker gets a user&amp;rsquo;s browser to execute his/her code, the code will run within the security context (or zone) of the hosting web site. With this level of privilege, the code has the ability to read, modify and transmit any sensitive data accessible by the browser. A Cross-site Scripted user could have his/her account hijacked (cookie theft), their browser redirected to another location, or possibly shown fraudulent content delivered by the web site they are visiting. Cross-site Scripting attacks essentially compromise the trust relationship between a user and the web site. Applications utilizing browser object instances which load content from the file system may execute code under the local machine zone allowing for system compromise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Including (but not limited to) Cross Site Scripting (XSS), and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page — covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The software constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed. In certain versions of Spring 3.0.5 and earlier, there was a vulnerability (CVE-2011-2730) in which Expression Language tags would be evaluated twice, which effectively exposed any application to EL injection. However, even for later versions, this weakness is still possible depending on configuration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;URL redirectors represent common functionality employed by web sites to forward an incoming request to an alternate resource. This can be done for a variety of reasons and is often done to allow resources to be moved within the directory structure and to avoid breaking functionality for users that request the resource at its previous location. URL redirectors may also be used to implement load balancing, leveraging abbreviated URLs or recording outgoing links. It is this last implementation which is often used in phishing attacks as described in the example below. URL redirectors do not necessarily represent a direct security vulnerability but can be abused by attackers trying to social engineer victims into believing that they are navigating to a site other than the true destination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By manipulating the padding on an encrypted string, an attacker is able to generate an error message that indicates a likely &amp;lsquo;padding oracle&amp;rsquo; vulnerability. Such a vulnerability can affect any application or framework that uses encryption improperly, such as some versions of ASP.net, Java Server Faces, and Mono. An attacker may exploit this issue to decrypt data and recover encryption keys, potentially viewing and modifying confidential data. This rule should detect the MS10-070 padding oracle vulnerability in ASP.net if CustomErrors are enabled for that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP) attacks consist of injecting encoded query string delimiters into other existing parameters. If a web application does not properly sanitize the user input, a malicious user can compromise the logic of the application to perform either client-side or server-side attacks. One consequence of HPP attacks is that the attacker can potentially override existing hard-coded HTTP parameters to modify the behavior of an application, bypass input validation checkpoints, and access and possibly exploit variables that may be out of direct reach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The server initiated a proxied request via the proxy specified in the HTTP Proxy header of the request.Httpoxy typically affects code running in CGI or CGI like environments.&#xA;This may allow attackers to:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Proxy the outgoing HTTP requests made by the web application&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Direct the server to open outgoing connections to an address and port of their choosing or&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tie up server resources by forcing the vulnerable software to use a malicious proxy.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This check identifies secure HTTPS pages that host insecure HTTP forms. The issue is that a secure page is transitioning to an insecure page when data is uploaded through a form. The user may think they&amp;rsquo;re submitting data to a secure page when in fact they are not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The most common methodology for attackers is to first footprint the target&amp;rsquo;s web presence and enumerate as much information as possible. With this information, the attacker may develop an accurate attack scenario, which will effectively exploit a vulnerability in the software type/version being utilized by the target host.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cookies can be scoped by domain or path. This check is only concerned with domain scope.The domain scope applied to a cookie determines which domains can access it. For example, a cookie can be scoped strictly to a subdomain e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nottrusted.com&#34;&gt;www.nottrusted.com&lt;/a&gt;, or loosely scoped to a parent domain e.g. nottrusted.com. In the latter case, any subdomain of nottrusted.com can access the cookie. Loosely scoped cookies are common in mega-applications like google.com and live.com. Cookies set from a subdomain like app.foo.bar are transmitted only to that domain by the browser. However, cookies scoped to a parent-level domain may be transmitted to the parent, or any subdomain of the parent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Open redirects are one of the OWASP 2010 Top Ten vulnerabilities. This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where open redirects might be possible. Open redirects occur when an application allows user-supplied input (e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;https://nottrusted.com&#34;&gt;https://nottrusted.com&lt;/a&gt;) to control an offsite redirect. This is generally a pretty accurate way to find where 301 or 302 redirects could be exploited by spammers or phishing attacks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cross-site Scripting (XSS) is an attack technique that involves echoing attacker-supplied code into a user&amp;rsquo;s browser instance. A browser instance can be a standard web browser client, or a browser object embedded in a software product such as the browser within WinAmp, an RSS reader, or an email client. The code itself is usually written in HTML/JavaScript, but may also extend to VBScript, ActiveX, Java, Flash, or any other browser-supported technology.&#xA;When an attacker gets a user&amp;rsquo;s browser to execute his/her code, the code will run within the security context (or zone) of the hosting web site. With this level of privilege, the code has the ability to read, modify and transmit any sensitive data accessible by the browser. A Cross-site Scripted user could have his/her account hijacked (cookie theft), their browser redirected to another location, or possibly shown fraudulent content delivered by the web site they are visiting. Cross-site Scripting attacks essentially compromise the trust relationship between a user and the web site. Applications utilizing browser object instances which load content from the file system may execute code under the local machine zone allowing for system compromise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The cache-control header has not been set properly or is missing, allowing the browser and proxies to cache content. For static assets like css, js, or image files this might be intended, however, the resources should be reviewed to ensure that no sensitive content will be cached.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Relative Path Confusion</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The web server is configured to serve responses to ambiguous URLs in a manner that is likely to lead to confusion about the correct &amp;ldquo;relative path&amp;rdquo; for the URL. Resources (CSS, images, etc.) are also specified in the page response using relative, rather than absolute URLs. In an attack, if the web browser parses the &amp;ldquo;cross-content&amp;rdquo; response in a permissive manner, or can be tricked into permissively parsing the &amp;ldquo;cross-content&amp;rdquo; response, using techniques such as framing, then the web browser may be fooled into interpreting HTML as CSS (or other content types), leading to an XSS vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Remote File Include (RFI) is an attack technique used to exploit &amp;ldquo;dynamic file include&amp;rdquo; mechanisms in web applications. When web applications take user input (URL, parameter value, etc.) and pass them into file include commands, the web application might be tricked into including remote files with malicious code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The content was retrieved from a shared cache. If the response data is sensitive, personal or user-specific, this may result in sensitive information being leaked. In some cases, this may even result in a user gaining complete control of the session of another user, depending on the configuration of the caching components in use in their environment. This is primarily an issue where caching servers such as &amp;ldquo;proxy&amp;rdquo; caches are configured on the local network. This configuration is typically found in corporate or educational environments, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Session Fixation may be possible. If this issue occurs with a login URL (where the user authenticates themselves to the application), then the URL may be given by an attacker, along with a fixed session id, to a victim, in order to later assume the identity of the victim using the given session id. If the issue occurs with a non-login page, the URL and fixed session id may only be used by an attacker to track an unauthenticated user&amp;rsquo;s actions. If the vulnerability occurs on a cookie field or a form field (POST parameter) rather than on a URL (GET) parameter, then some other vulnerability may also be required in order to set the cookie field on the victim&amp;rsquo;s browser, to allow the vulnerability to be exploited.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Storable and Cacheable Content</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The response contents are storable by caching components such as proxy servers, and may be retrieved directly from the cache, rather than from the origin server by the caching servers, in response to similar requests from other users. If the response data is sensitive, personal or user-specific, this may result in sensitive information being leaked. In some cases, this may even result in a user gaining complete control of the session of another user, depending on the configuration of the caching components in use in their environment. This is primarily an issue where &amp;ldquo;shared&amp;rdquo; caching servers such as &amp;ldquo;proxy&amp;rdquo; caches are configured on the local network. This configuration is typically found in corporate or educational environments, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where Content-Type or meta tag charset declarations might be user-controlled. Such charset declarations should always be declared by the application. If an attacker can control the response charset, they could manipulate the HTML to perform XSS or other attacks. For example, an attacker controlling the &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; element charset value is able to declare UTF-7 and is also able to include enough user-controlled payload early in the HTML document to have it interpreted as UTF-7. By encoding their payload with UTF-7 the attacker is able to bypass any server-side XSS protections and embed script in the page.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This technique takes advantage of a feature of XML to build documents dynamically at the time of processing. An XML message can either provide data explicitly or by pointing to an URI where the data exists. In the attack technique, external entities may replace the entity value with malicious data, alternate referrals or may compromise the security of the data the server/XML application has access to.&#xA;Attackers may also use External Entities to have the web services server download malicious code or content to the server for use in secondary or follow on attacks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;XPath Injection is an attack technique used to exploit applications that construct XPath (XML Path Language) queries from user-supplied input to query or navigate XML documents. It can be used directly by an application to query an XML document, as part of a larger operation such as applying an XSLT transformation to an XML document, or applying an XQuery to an XML document. The syntax of XPath bears some resemblance to an SQL query, and indeed, it is possible to form SQL-like queries on an XML document using XPath.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
