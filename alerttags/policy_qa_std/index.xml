      <title>Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens</title>
      <link>/docs/alerts/10202/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;No Anti-CSRF tokens were found in a HTML submission form.&#xA;A cross-site request forgery is an attack that involves forcing a victim to send an HTTP request to a target destination without their knowledge or intent in order to perform an action as the victim. The underlying cause is application functionality using predictable URL/form actions in a repeatable way. The nature of the attack is that CSRF exploits the trust that a web site has for a user. By contrast, cross-site scripting (XSS) exploits the trust that a user has for a web site. Like XSS, CSRF attacks are not necessarily cross-site, but they can be. Cross-site request forgery is also known as CSRF, XSRF, one-click attack, session riding, confused deputy, and sea surf.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This page contains an error/warning message that may disclose sensitive information like the location of the file that produced the unhandled exception. This information can be used to launch further attacks against the web application. The alert could be a false positive if the error message is found inside a documentation page.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Authentication Credentials Captured</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An insecure authentication mechanism is in use. This allows an attacker on the network access to the userid and password of the authenticated user. For Basic Authentication, the attacker must merely monitor the network traffic until a Basic Authentication request is received, and then base64 decode the username and password. For Digest Authentication, the attacker has access to the username, and possibly also the password, if the hash (including a nonce) can be successfully cracked, or if a Man-In-The-Middle attack is mounted.&#xA;The attacker eavesdrops on the network until an authentication has completed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A cookie has been set without the HttpOnly flag, which means that the cookie can be accessed by JavaScript. If a malicious script can be run on this page then the cookie will be accessible and can be transmitted to another site. If this is a session cookie then session hijacking may be possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where cookie parameters might be controlled. This is called a cookie poisoning attack, and becomes exploitable when an attacker can manipulate the cookie in various ways. In some cases this will not be exploitable, however, allowing URL parameters to set cookie values is generally considered a bug.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This CORS misconfiguration could allow an attacker to perform AJAX queries to the vulnerable website from a malicious page loaded by the victim&amp;rsquo;s user agent.&#xA;In order to perform authenticated AJAX queries, the server must specify the header &amp;ldquo;Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&amp;rdquo; header must be set to null or the malicious page&amp;rsquo;s domain. Even if this misconfiguration doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow authenticated AJAX requests, unauthenticated sensitive content can still be accessed (e.g intranet websites).&#xA;A malicious page can belong to a malicious website but also a trusted website with flaws (e.g XSS, support of HTTP without TLS allowing code injection through MITM, etc).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cross-site Scripting (XSS) is an attack technique that involves echoing attacker-supplied code into a user&amp;rsquo;s browser instance. A browser instance can be a standard web browser client, or a browser object embedded in a software product such as the browser within WinAmp, an RSS reader, or an email client. The code itself is usually written in HTML/JavaScript, but may also extend to VBScript, ActiveX, Java, Flash, or any other browser-supported technology.&#xA;When an attacker gets a user&amp;rsquo;s browser to execute his/her code, the code will run within the security context (or zone) of the hosting web site. With this level of privilege, the code has the ability to read, modify and transmit any sensitive data accessible by the browser. A Cross-site Scripted user could have his/her account hijacked (cookie theft), their browser redirected to another location, or possibly shown fraudulent content delivered by the web site they are visiting. Cross-site Scripting attacks essentially compromise the trust relationship between a user and the web site. Applications utilizing browser object instances which load content from the file system may execute code under the local machine zone allowing for system compromise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks. Including (but not limited to) Cross Site Scripting (XSS), and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page — covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The software constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed. In certain versions of Spring 3.0.5 and earlier, there was a vulnerability (CVE-2011-2730) in which Expression Language tags would be evaluated twice, which effectively exposed any application to EL injection. However, even for later versions, this weakness is still possible depending on configuration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;URL redirectors represent common functionality employed by web sites to forward an incoming request to an alternate resource. This can be done for a variety of reasons and is often done to allow resources to be moved within the directory structure and to avoid breaking functionality for users that request the resource at its previous location. URL redirectors may also be used to implement load balancing, leveraging abbreviated URLs or recording outgoing links. It is this last implementation which is often used in phishing attacks as described in the example below. URL redirectors do not necessarily represent a direct security vulnerability but can be abused by attackers trying to social engineer victims into believing that they are navigating to a site other than the true destination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A request that was originally observed as a POST was also accepted as a GET. This issue does not represent a security weakness unto itself, however, it may facilitate simplification of other attacks. For example if the original POST is subject to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), then this finding may indicate that a simplified (GET based) XSS may also be possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cookies can be scoped by domain or path. This check is only concerned with domain scope.The domain scope applied to a cookie determines which domains can access it. For example, a cookie can be scoped strictly to a subdomain e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nottrusted.com&#34;&gt;www.nottrusted.com&lt;/a&gt;, or loosely scoped to a parent domain e.g. nottrusted.com. In the latter case, any subdomain of nottrusted.com can access the cookie. Loosely scoped cookies are common in mega-applications like google.com and live.com. Cookies set from a subdomain like app.foo.bar are transmitted only to that domain by the browser. However, cookies scoped to a parent-level domain may be transmitted to the parent, or any subdomain of the parent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Open redirects are one of the OWASP 2010 Top Ten vulnerabilities. This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where open redirects might be possible. Open redirects occur when an application allows user-supplied input (e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;https://nottrusted.com&#34;&gt;https://nottrusted.com&lt;/a&gt;) to control an off-site destination. This is generally a pretty accurate way to find where 301 or 302 redirects could be exploited by spammers or phishing attacks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

An attacker may manipulate a URL in such a way that the web site will execute or reveal the contents of arbitrary files anywhere on the web server. Any device that exposes an HTTP-based interface is potentially vulnerable to Path Traversal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Permissions Policy Header is an added layer of security that helps to restrict from unauthorized access or usage of browser/client features by web resources. This policy ensures the user privacy by limiting or specifying the features of the browsers can be used by the web resources. Permissions Policy provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to limit which features of browsers can be used by the page such as camera, microphone, location, full screen etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) headers were found, a response with multiple HSTS header entries is not compliant with the specification (RFC 6797) and only the first HSTS header will be processed others will be ignored by user agents or the HSTS policy may be incorrectly applied.&#xA;HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a web security policy mechanism whereby a web server declares that complying user agents (such as a web browser) are to interact with it using only secure HTTPS connections (i.e. HTTP layered over TLS/SSL).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The integrity attribute is missing on a script or link tag served by an external server. The integrity tag prevents an attacker who have gained access to this server from injecting a malicious content.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>X-ChromeLogger-Data (XCOLD) Header Information Leak</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The server is leaking information through the X-ChromeLogger-Data (or X-ChromePhp-Data) response header. The content of such headers can be customized by the developer, however it is not uncommon to find: server file system locations, vhost declarations, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to &amp;rsquo;nosniff&amp;rsquo;. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type. Current (early 2014) and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type (if one is set), rather than performing MIME-sniffing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>XML External Entity Attack</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This technique takes advantage of a feature of XML to build documents dynamically at the time of processing. An XML message can either provide data explicitly or by pointing to an URI where the data exists. In the attack technique, external entities may replace the entity value with malicious data, alternate referrals or may compromise the security of the data the server/XML application has access to.&#xA;Attackers may also use External Entities to have the web services server download malicious code or content to the server for use in secondary or follow on attacks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>XPath Injection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;XPath Injection is an attack technique used to exploit applications that construct XPath (XML Path Language) queries from user-supplied input to query or navigate XML documents. It can be used directly by an application to query an XML document, as part of a larger operation such as applying an XSLT transformation to an XML document, or applying an XQuery to an XML document. The syntax of XPath bears some resemblance to an SQL query, and indeed, it is possible to form SQL-like queries on an XML document using XPath.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Injection using XSL transformations may be possible, and may allow an attacker to read system information, read and write files, or execute arbitrary code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
