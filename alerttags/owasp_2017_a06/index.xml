      <description>&lt;p&gt;A cross-site request forgery is an attack that involves forcing a victim to send an HTTP request to a target destination without their knowledge or intent in order to perform an action as the victim. The underlying cause is application functionality using predictable URL/form actions in a repeatable way. The nature of the attack is that CSRF exploits the trust that a web site has for a user. By contrast, cross-site scripting (XSS) exploits the trust that a user has for a web site. Like XSS, CSRF attacks are not necessarily cross-site, but they can be. Cross-site request forgery is also known as CSRF, XSRF, one-click attack, session riding, confused deputy, and sea surf.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This page contains an error/warning message that may disclose sensitive information like the location of the file that produced the unhandled exception. This information can be used to launch further attacks against the web application.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Cloud Metadata Attack attempts to abuse a misconfigured NGINX server in order to access the instance metadata maintained by cloud service providers such as AWS, GCP and Azure.&#xA;All of these providers provide metadata via an internal unroutable IP address &amp;lsquo;169.254.169.254&amp;rsquo; - this can be exposed by incorrectly configured NGINX servers and accessed by using this IP address in the Host header field.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page — covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Generic Padding Oracle</title>

      <guid>/docs/alerts/90024/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;By manipulating the padding on an encrypted string, an attacker is able to generate an error message that indicates a likely &amp;lsquo;padding oracle&amp;rsquo; vulnerability. Such a vulnerability can affect any application or framework that uses encryption improperly, such as some versions of ASP.net, Java Server Faces, and Mono. An attacker may exploit this issue to decrypt data and recover encryption keys, potentially viewing and modifying confidential data. This rule should detect the MS10-070 padding oracle vulnerability in ASP.net if CustomErrors are enabled for that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A request that was originally observed as a POST was also accepted as a GET. This issue does not represent a security weakness unto itself, however, it may facilitate simplification of other attacks. For example if the original POST is subject to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), then this finding may indicate that a simplified (GET based) XSS may also be possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This check looks for insecure HTTP pages that host HTTPS forms. The issue is that an insecure HTTP page can easily be hijacked through MITM and the secure HTTPS form can be replaced or spoofed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This check identifies secure HTTPS pages that host insecure HTTP forms. The issue is that a secure page is transitioning to an insecure page when data is uploaded through a form. The user may think they&amp;rsquo;re submitting data to a secure page when in fact they are not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The most common methodology for attackers is to first footprint the target&amp;rsquo;s web presence and enumerate as much information as possible. With this information, the attacker may develop an accurate attack scenario, which will effectively exploit a vulnerability in the software type/version being utilized by the target host.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cookies can be scoped by domain or path. This check is only concerned with domain scope.The domain scope applied to a cookie determines which domains can access it. For example, a cookie can be scoped strictly to a subdomain e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nottrusted.com&#34;&gt;www.nottrusted.com&lt;/a&gt;, or loosely scoped to a parent domain e.g. nottrusted.com. In the latter case, any subdomain of nottrusted.com can access the cookie. Loosely scoped cookies are common in mega-applications like google.com and live.com. Cookies set from a subdomain like app.foo.bar are transmitted only to that domain by the browser. However, cookies scoped to a parent-level domain may be transmitted to the parent, or any subdomain of the parent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It may be possible to enumerate usernames, based on differing HTTP responses when valid and invalid usernames are provided. This would greatly increase the probability of success of password brute-forcing attacks against the system.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The web server is configured to serve responses to ambiguous URLs in a manner that is likely to lead to confusion about the correct &amp;ldquo;relative path&amp;rdquo; for the URL. Resources (CSS, images, etc.) are also specified in the page response using relative, rather than absolute URLs. In an attack, if the web browser parses the &amp;ldquo;cross-content&amp;rdquo; response in a permissive manner, or can be tricked into permissively parsing the &amp;ldquo;cross-content&amp;rdquo; response, using techniques such as framing, then the web browser may be fooled into interpreting HTML as CSS (or other content types), leading to an XSS vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The web/application server is leaking the application it uses as a webserver via the &amp;ldquo;Server&amp;rdquo; HTTP response header. Access to such information may facilitate attackers identifying other vulnerabilities your web/application server is subject to. This information alone, i.e. without a version string, is not very dangerous for the security of a server, nevertheless this information in the response header field is almost always useless and thus just an obsolete attacking vector.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>X-Backend-Server Header Information Leak</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The server is leaking information pertaining to backend systems (such as hostnames or IP addresses). Armed with this information an attacker may be able to attack other systems or more directly/efficiently attack those systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing</title>
      <link>/docs/alerts/10021/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to &amp;rsquo;nosniff&amp;rsquo;. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type. Current (early 2014) and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type (if one is set), rather than performing MIME-sniffing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An X-Frame-Options (XFO) META tag was found, defining XFO via a META tag is explicitly not supported by the spec (RFC 7034).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
