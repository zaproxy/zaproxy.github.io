      <title>GET for POST</title>

      <description>A request that was originally observed as a POST was also accepted as a GET. This issue does not represent a security weakness unto itself, however, it may facilitate simplification of other attacks. For example if the original POST is subject to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), then this finding may indicate that a simplified (GET based) XSS may also be possible.</description>

      <description>At least one link on this page is vulnerable to Reverse tabnabbing as it uses a target attribute without using both of the &amp;ldquo;noopener&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;noreferrer&amp;rdquo; keywords in the &amp;ldquo;rel&amp;rdquo; attribute, which allows the target page to take control of this page.</description>
