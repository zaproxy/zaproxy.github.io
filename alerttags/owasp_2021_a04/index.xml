      <title>GET for POST</title>

      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/docs/alerts/10058/</guid>
      <description>A request that was originally observed as a POST was also accepted as a GET. This issue does not represent a security weakness unto itself, however, it may facilitate simplification of other attacks. For example if the original POST is subject to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), then this finding may indicate that a simplified (GET based) XSS may also be possible.</description>

      <description>Java Serialization seems to be in use. If not correctly validated, an attacker can send a specially crafted object. This can lead to a dangerous &amp;ldquo;Remote Code Execution&amp;rdquo;. A magic sequence identifying JSO has been detected (Base64: rO0AB, Raw: 0xac, 0xed, 0x00, 0x05).</description>

      <guid>/docs/alerts/10108/</guid>
      <description>At least one link on this page is vulnerable to Reverse tabnabbing as it uses a target attribute without using both of the &amp;ldquo;noopener&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;noreferrer&amp;rdquo; keywords in the &amp;ldquo;rel&amp;rdquo; attribute, which allows the target page to take control of this page.</description>
