      <title>HTTP Parameter Pollution</title>
      <link>/docs/alerts/20014/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP) attacks consist of injecting encoded query string delimiters into other existing parameters. If a web application does not properly sanitize the user input, a malicious user can compromise the logic of the application to perform either client-side or server-side attacks. One consequence of HPP attacks is that the attacker can potentially override existing hard-coded HTTP parameters to modify the behavior of an application, bypass input validation checkpoints, and access and possibly exploit variables that may be out of direct reach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Httpoxy - Proxy Header Misuse</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The server initiated a proxied request via the proxy specified in the HTTP Proxy header of the request.Httpoxy typically affects code running in CGI or CGI like environments.&#xA;This may allow attackers to:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Proxy the outgoing HTTP requests made by the web application&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Direct the server to open outgoing connections to an address and port of their choosing or&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tie up server resources by forcing the vulnerable software to use a malicious proxy.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <title>Relative Path Confusion</title>
      <link>/docs/alerts/10051/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The web server is configured to serve responses to ambiguous URLs in a manner that is likely to lead to confusion about the correct &amp;ldquo;relative path&amp;rdquo; for the URL. Resources (CSS, images, etc.) are also specified in the page response using relative, rather than absolute URLs. In an attack, if the web browser parses the &amp;ldquo;cross-content&amp;rdquo; response in a permissive manner, or can be tricked into permissively parsing the &amp;ldquo;cross-content&amp;rdquo; response, using techniques such as framing, then the web browser may be fooled into interpreting HTML as CSS (or other content types), leading to an XSS vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Potential RPO (Relative Path Overwrite) found. RPO allows attackers to manipulate URLs to include unintended paths, potentially leading to the execution of malicious scripts or the disclosure of sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Remote Code Execution - CVE-2012-1823</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some PHP versions, when configured to run using CGI, do not correctly handle query strings that lack an unescaped &amp;ldquo;=&amp;rdquo; character, enabling arbitrary code execution. In this case, an operating system command was caused to be executed on the web server, and the results were returned to the web browser.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some PHP versions, when configured to run using CGI, do not correctly handle query strings that lack an unescaped &amp;ldquo;=&amp;rdquo; character, enabling PHP source code disclosure, and arbitrary code execution. In this case, the contents of the PHP file were served directly to the web browser. This output will typically contain PHP, although it may also contain straight HTML.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The application performed a suspicious input transformation that may indicate a security vulnerability. The input was transformed in an unexpected way, suggesting potential issues with input validation, encoding/decoding, or expression evaluation. This could indicate vulnerabilities such as server-side template injection, expression language injection, unicode normalization issues, or other input processing flaws that may be exploitable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>User Controllable Charset</title>

      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/docs/alerts/10030/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where Content-Type or meta tag charset declarations might be user-controlled. Such charset declarations should always be declared by the application. If an attacker can control the response charset, they could manipulate the HTML to perform XSS or other attacks. For example, an attacker controlling the &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; element charset value is able to declare UTF-7 and is also able to include enough user-controlled payload early in the HTML document to have it interpreted as UTF-7. By encoding their payload with UTF-7 the attacker is able to bypass any server-side XSS protections and embed script in the page.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>User Controllable HTML Element Attribute (Potential XSS)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where certain HTML attribute values might be controlled. This provides hot-spot detection for XSS (cross-site scripting) that will require further review by a security analyst to determine exploitability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
