      <title>Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens</title>
      <link>/docs/alerts/10202/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>No Anti-CSRF tokens were found in a HTML submission form. A cross-site request forgery is an attack that involves forcing a victim to send an HTTP request to a target destination without their knowledge or intent in order to perform an action as the victim. The underlying cause is application functionality using predictable URL/form actions in a repeatable way.</description>

      <title>Access Control Issue - Improper Authentication</title>
      <link>/docs/alerts/10101/</link>

      <description>Insufficient Authentication occurs when a web site permits an attacker to access sensitive content or functionality without having to properly authenticate. Web-based administration tools are a good example of web sites providing access to sensitive functionality. Depending on the specific online resource, these web applications should not be directly accessible without requiring the user to properly verify their identity.</description>

      <title>Access Control Issue - Improper Authorization</title>
      <link>/docs/alerts/10102/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/docs/alerts/10102/</guid>
      <description>Insufficient Authorization results when an application does not perform adequate authorization checks to ensure that the user is performing a function or accessing data in a manner consistent with the security policy. Authorization procedures should enforce what a user, service or application is permitted to do. When a user is authenticated to a web site, it does not necessarily mean that the user should have full access to all content and functionality.</description>

      <title>Cookie with Invalid SameSite Attribute</title>

      <description>A cookie has been set with an invalid SameSite attribute value, which means that the cookie can be sent as a result of a &amp;lsquo;cross-site&amp;rsquo; request. The SameSite attribute is an effective counter measure to cross-site request forgery, cross-site script inclusion, and timing attacks.</description>

      <description>A cookie has been set with its SameSite attribute set to &amp;ldquo;none&amp;rdquo;, which means that the cookie can be sent as a result of a &amp;lsquo;cross-site&amp;rsquo; request. The SameSite attribute is an effective counter measure to cross-site request forgery, cross-site script inclusion, and timing attacks.</description>

      <description>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any other origins (domain, scheme, or port) than its own from which a browser should permit loading of resources. It relaxes the Same-Origin Policy (SOP).</description>

      <title>CORS Misconfiguration</title>

      <description>This CORS misconfiguration could allow an attacker to perform AJAX queries to the vulnerable website from a malicious page loaded by the victim&amp;rsquo;s user agent. In order to perform authenticated AJAX queries, the server must specify the header &amp;ldquo;Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&amp;rdquo; header must be set to null or the malicious page&amp;rsquo;s domain.</description>

      <description>The Path Traversal attack technique allows an attacker access to files, directories, and commands that potentially reside outside the web document root directory. An attacker may manipulate a URL in such a way that the web site will execute or reveal the contents of arbitrary files anywhere on the web server.</description>

      <description>Permissions Policy Header is an added layer of security that helps to restrict from unauthorized access or usage of browser/client features by web resources. This policy ensures the user privacy by limiting or specifying the features of the browsers can be used by the web resources. Permissions Policy provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to limit which features of browsers can be used by the page such as camera, microphone, location, full screen etc.</description>

      <description>Session Fixation may be possible. If this issue occurs with a login URL (where the user authenticates themselves to the application), then the URL may be given by an attacker, along with a fixed session id, to a victim, in order to later assume the identity of the victim using the given session id.</description>

      <description>Spring Actuator for Health is enabled and may reveal sensitive information about this application. Spring Actuators can be used for real monitoring purposes, but should be used with caution as to not expose too much information about the application or the infrastructure running it.</description>

      <description>A hash of a username (admin) was found in the response. This may indicate that the application is subject to an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability. Manual testing will be required to see if this discovery can be abused.</description>
