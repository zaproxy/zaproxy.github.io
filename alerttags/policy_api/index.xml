      <title>Buffer Overflow</title>
      <link>/docs/alerts/30001/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Buffer overflow errors are characterized by the overwriting of memory spaces of the background web process, which should have never been modified intentionally or unintentionally. Overwriting values of the IP (Instruction Pointer), BP (Base Pointer) and other registers causes exceptions, segmentation faults, and other process errors to occur. Usually these errors end execution of the application in an unexpected way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Cloud Metadata Potentially Exposed</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Cloud Metadata Attack attempts to abuse a misconfigured NGINX server in order to access the instance metadata maintained by cloud service providers such as AWS, GCP and Azure.&#xA;All of these providers provide metadata via an internal unroutable IP address &amp;lsquo;169.254.169.254&amp;rsquo; - this can be exposed by incorrectly configured NGINX servers and accessed by using this IP address in the Host header field.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cookie can be set via CRLF injection. It may also be possible to set arbitrary HTTP response headers. In addition, by carefully crafting the injected response using cross-site script, cache poisoning vulnerability may also exist.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Exponential Entity Expansion (Billion Laughs Attack)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An exponential entity expansion, or &amp;ldquo;billion laughs&amp;rdquo; attack is a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack. It is aimed at parsers of markup languages like XML or YAML that allow macro expansions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Exposed Secrets in Swagger/OpenAPI Path</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Swagger UI endpoint exposes sensitive secrets such as client secrets, API keys, or OAuth tokens. These secrets may be accessible in the HTML source and should not be exposed publicly, as this can lead to compromise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Expression Language Injection</title>
      <link>/docs/alerts/90025/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/docs/alerts/90025/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The software constructs all or part of an expression language (EL) statement in a Java Server Page (JSP) using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended EL statement before it is executed. In certain versions of Spring 3.0.5 and earlier, there was a vulnerability (CVE-2011-2730) in which Expression Language tags would be evaluated twice, which effectively exposed any application to EL injection. However, even for later versions, this weakness is still possible depending on configuration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;URL redirectors represent common functionality employed by web sites to forward an incoming request to an alternate resource. This can be done for a variety of reasons and is often done to allow resources to be moved within the directory structure and to avoid breaking functionality for users that request the resource at its previous location. URL redirectors may also be used to implement load balancing, leveraging abbreviated URLs or recording outgoing links. It is this last implementation which is often used in phishing attacks as described in the example below. URL redirectors do not necessarily represent a direct security vulnerability but can be abused by attackers trying to social engineer victims into believing that they are navigating to a site other than the true destination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Remote File Inclusion</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Remote File Include (RFI) is an attack technique used to exploit &amp;ldquo;dynamic file include&amp;rdquo; mechanisms in web applications. When web applications take user input (URL, parameter value, etc.) and pass them into file include commands, the web application might be tricked into including remote files with malicious code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This technique takes advantage of a feature of XML to build documents dynamically at the time of processing. An XML message can either provide data explicitly or by pointing to an URI where the data exists. In the attack technique, external entities may replace the entity value with malicious data, alternate referrals or may compromise the security of the data the server/XML application has access to.&#xA;Attackers may also use External Entities to have the web services server download malicious code or content to the server for use in secondary or follow on attacks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>XPath Injection</title>

      <guid>/docs/alerts/90021/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;XPath Injection is an attack technique used to exploit applications that construct XPath (XML Path Language) queries from user-supplied input to query or navigate XML documents. It can be used directly by an application to query an XML document, as part of a larger operation such as applying an XSLT transformation to an XML document, or applying an XQuery to an XML document. The syntax of XPath bears some resemblance to an SQL query, and indeed, it is possible to form SQL-like queries on an XML document using XPath.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
