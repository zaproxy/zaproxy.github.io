      <description>&lt;p&gt;A cross-site request forgery is an attack that involves forcing a victim to send an HTTP request to a target destination without their knowledge or intent in order to perform an action as the victim. The underlying cause is application functionality using predictable URL/form actions in a repeatable way. The nature of the attack is that CSRF exploits the trust that a web site has for a user. By contrast, cross-site scripting (XSS) exploits the trust that a user has for a web site. Like XSS, CSRF attacks are not necessarily cross-site, but they can be. Cross-site request forgery is also known as CSRF, XSRF, one-click attack, session riding, confused deputy, and sea surf.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Cloud Metadata Attack attempts to abuse a misconfigured NGINX server in order to access the instance metadata maintained by cloud service providers such as AWS, GCP and Azure.&#xA;All of these providers provide metadata via an internal unroutable IP address &amp;lsquo;169.254.169.254&amp;rsquo; - this can be exposed by incorrectly configured NGINX servers and accessed by using this IP address in the Host header field.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page — covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The image was found to contain embedded location information, such as GPS coordinates, or another privacy exposure, such as camera serial number.  Depending on the context of the image in the website, this information may expose private details of the users of a site.  For example, a site that allows users to upload profile pictures taken in the home may expose the home&amp;rsquo;s address.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The most common methodology for attackers is to first footprint the target&amp;rsquo;s web presence and enumerate as much information as possible. With this information, the attacker may develop an accurate attack scenario, which will effectively exploit a vulnerability in the software type/version being utilized by the target host.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It may be possible to enumerate usernames, based on differing HTTP responses when valid and invalid usernames are provided. This would greatly increase the probability of success of password brute-forcing attacks against the system. Note that false positives may sometimes be minimised by increasing the &amp;lsquo;Attack Strength&amp;rsquo; Option in ZAP. Please manually check the &amp;lsquo;Other Info&amp;rsquo; field to confirm if this is actually an issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The web server is configured to serve responses to ambiguous URLs in a manner that is likely to lead to confusion about the correct &amp;ldquo;relative path&amp;rdquo; for the URL. Resources (CSS, images, etc.) are also specified in the page response using relative, rather than absolute URLs. In an attack, if the web browser parses the &amp;ldquo;cross-content&amp;rdquo; response in a permissive manner, or can be tricked into permissively parsing the &amp;ldquo;cross-content&amp;rdquo; response, using techniques such as framing, then the web browser may be fooled into interpreting HTML as CSS (or other content types), leading to an XSS vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The web/application server is leaking the application it uses as a webserver via the &amp;ldquo;Server&amp;rdquo; HTTP response header. Access to such information may facilitate attackers identifying other vulnerabilities your web/application server is subject to. This information alone, i.e. without a version string, is not very dangerous for the security of a server, nevertheless this information in the response header field is almost always useless and thus just an obsolete attacking vector.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Path Traversal attack technique allows an attacker access to files, directories, and commands that potentially reside outside the web document root directory. An attacker may manipulate a URL in such a way that the web site will execute or reveal the contents of arbitrary files anywhere on the web server. Any device that exposes an HTTP-based interface is potentially vulnerable to Path Traversal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
