      <title>Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page — covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>CSP: Failure to Define Directive with No Fallback</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Content Security Policy fails to define one of the directives that has no fallback. Missing/excluding them is the same as allowing anything.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The message contained both CSP specified via header and via Meta tag. It was not possible to union these policies in order to perform an analysis. Therefore, they have been evaluated individually.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy header is a response header that allows a site to control if others included documents share the same browsing context. Sharing the same browsing context with untrusted documents might lead to data leak.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Permissions Policy Header is an added layer of security that helps to restrict from unauthorized access or usage of browser/client features by web resources. This policy ensures the user privacy by limiting or specifying the features of the browsers can be used by the web resources. Permissions Policy provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to limit which features of browsers can be used by the page such as camera, microphone, location, full screen etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to &amp;rsquo;nosniff&amp;rsquo;. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type. Current (early 2014) and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type (if one is set), rather than performing MIME-sniffing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
