      <title>Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens</title>
      <link>/docs/alerts/10202/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;No Anti-CSRF tokens were found in a HTML submission form.&#xA;A cross-site request forgery is an attack that involves forcing a victim to send an HTTP request to a target destination without their knowledge or intent in order to perform an action as the victim. The underlying cause is application functionality using predictable URL/form actions in a repeatable way. The nature of the attack is that CSRF exploits the trust that a web site has for a user. By contrast, cross-site scripting (XSS) exploits the trust that a user has for a web site. Like XSS, CSRF attacks are not necessarily cross-site, but they can be. Cross-site request forgery is also known as CSRF, XSRF, one-click attack, session riding, confused deputy, and sea surf.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page — covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A cookie has been set without the HttpOnly flag, which means that the cookie can be accessed by JavaScript. If a malicious script can be run on this page then the cookie will be accessible and can be transmitted to another site. If this is a session cookie then session hijacking may be possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where cookie parameters might be controlled. This is called a cookie poisoning attack, and becomes exploitable when an attacker can manipulate the cookie in various ways. In some cases this will not be exploitable, however, allowing URL parameters to set cookie values is generally considered a bug.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Repeated GET requests: drop a different cookie each time, followed by normal request with all cookies to stabilize session, compare responses against original baseline GET. This can reveal areas where cookie based authentication/attributes are not actually enforced.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A cookie has been set with an invalid SameSite attribute value, which means that the cookie can be sent as a result of a &amp;lsquo;cross-site&amp;rsquo; request.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any other origins (domain, scheme, or port) than its own from which a browser should permit loading of resources. It relaxes the Same-Origin Policy (SOP).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This CORS misconfiguration could allow an attacker to perform AJAX queries to the vulnerable website from a malicious page loaded by the victim&amp;rsquo;s user agent.&#xA;In order to perform authenticated AJAX queries, the server must specify the header &amp;ldquo;Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&amp;rdquo; header must be set to null or the malicious page&amp;rsquo;s domain. Even if this misconfiguration doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow authenticated AJAX requests, unauthenticated sensitive content can still be accessed (e.g intranet websites).&#xA;A malicious page can belong to a malicious website but also a trusted website with flaws (e.g XSS, support of HTTP without TLS allowing code injection through MITM, etc).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks. Including (but not limited to) Cross Site Scripting (XSS), and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page — covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cookies can be scoped by domain or path. This check is only concerned with domain scope.The domain scope applied to a cookie determines which domains can access it. For example, a cookie can be scoped strictly to a subdomain e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nottrusted.com&#34;&gt;www.nottrusted.com&lt;/a&gt;, or loosely scoped to a parent domain e.g. nottrusted.com. In the latter case, any subdomain of nottrusted.com can access the cookie. Loosely scoped cookies are common in mega-applications like google.com and live.com. Cookies set from a subdomain like app.foo.bar are transmitted only to that domain by the browser. However, cookies scoped to a parent-level domain may be transmitted to the parent, or any subdomain of the parent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Permissions Policy Header is an added layer of security that helps to restrict from unauthorized access or usage of browser/client features by web resources. This policy ensures the user privacy by limiting or specifying the features of the browsers can be used by the web resources. Permissions Policy provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to limit which features of browsers can be used by the page such as camera, microphone, location, full screen etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In some cases, this may even result in a user gaining complete control of the session of another user, depending on the configuration of the caching components in use in their environment. This is primarily an issue where caching servers such as &amp;ldquo;proxy&amp;rdquo; caches are configured on the local network.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The response contents are storable by caching components such as proxy servers, and may be retrieved directly from the cache, rather than from the origin server by the caching servers, in response to similar requests from other users. If the response data is sensitive, personal or user-specific, this may result in sensitive information being leaked. In some cases, this may even result in a user gaining complete control of the session of another user, depending on the configuration of the caching components in use in their environment. This is primarily an issue where &amp;ldquo;shared&amp;rdquo; caching servers such as &amp;ldquo;proxy&amp;rdquo; caches are configured on the local network. This configuration is typically found in corporate or educational environments, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>User Controllable Charset</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where Content-Type or meta tag charset declarations might be user-controlled. Such charset declarations should always be declared by the application. If an attacker can control the response charset, they could manipulate the HTML to perform XSS or other attacks. For example, an attacker controlling the &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; element charset value is able to declare UTF-7 and is also able to include enough user-controlled payload early in the HTML document to have it interpreted as UTF-7. By encoding their payload with UTF-7 the attacker is able to bypass any server-side XSS protections and embed script in the page.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The server is leaking information through the X-ChromeLogger-Data (or X-ChromePhp-Data) response header.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to &amp;rsquo;nosniff&amp;rsquo;. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type. Current (early 2014) and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type (if one is set), rather than performing MIME-sniffing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
